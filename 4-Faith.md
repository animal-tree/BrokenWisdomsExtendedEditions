### Right to talk about suicide seriously

> [!WARNING]
> Trigger warning: I want to die.

Most people seriously considering suicide can't talk about it, not unless they bury the very-conscious awareness of the standard policy of hospitalization and drugging. The more seriously somebody genuinely needs to talk about their depression amid a genine imminent plan, the less they legally can without risking the security of their plan. The point of Right To Die, as I define it, is to legalize suicide-plan therapy.

Right To Die is not the same as Right For Physician To Commit Physician-Assisted Suicide in my opinion. One permits being able to talk about suicide, and not shaming or punishing a person for doing so, the other gives doctors permission to assist with that suicide. The latter also has merits, and before we get into what I'm proposing, let's look at a couple of those merits to see that even the radical variant, wherein doctors can assist with the suicide, makes sense.
- Available death guarantees some peace of mind, enough for people going through unbelievable circumstances to possibly relax, with some security, to regain a sense of optimism to pursue with their life. That availability is usually highly therapeutic, as long as it's not taken up to its final conclusion, and even then, for the victim anyway, that's arguably very therapeutic. 
- The peaceful version doesn't involve bodies splattering from buildings, or in front of locomotives, or from bullet wounds on the walls that witnesses arrive to. Other methods require research ability and skill to carry out singlehandedly. Yet other methods can cause permanent damage to brain or body, reducing life quality even more.

Suicide is legal in many places, including New York State. Coerced hospitalization and drugging, however, are pretty standard.

Right To Die, by my way more literal interpretation, only changes one thing from the current legality in New York: gets rid of involuntary institutionalization and coerced chemicals for planning to commit, and therefore talking about planning to commit, suicide. The main advantage of changing medical practices as such is the ability for somebody planning to commit suicide, but not wanting the security of their plan ruined, to talk about it, and not just through philosophy and art.

> [!NOTE]
> The magnitude of the relevance of "Art made tongue-tied by authority and folly, doctor-like controlling skill" is impossible to communicate. I worked under Chenliang and the university's arbitrations as "captive good attending to captain evil," devotedly and faithfully serving them, beyond their highest expectations, within what was physically and temporally afforded me, and even beyond that. And indeed, "doctor-like" controlling skill is the analogy Shakespeare turned to, to describe the kind of authority that governs, not just Chenliang's group, but most of the university, academia, and — most un-medically — medicine. My intuitive ideas, ahead of their time, were often preemptively dismissed and disregarded, until I found the right phrasing and pictures for the faculty to teach and convince them. "Simple truth miscall'd simplicity." The CS department's faculty, with occasional exception, couldn't hear anything that their minds didn't want to, that they hadn't already internalized for multiple decades during their careers, that they weren't already clinically versed on, taught to them by their schools, normalized by their colleagues, and standardized. "And strength by limping sway disabled," as I limp both in my words here to re-visit the traumas (having edited this paragraph many times against the existing linguistic voice's resistance), and literally, to walk, from the eczema on my legs, caused throughout my PhD by anxiety, and currently by the stress of describing the faith forsworn and right perfection disgrace'd while I was coerced, abused ("treated"), and worked there.

> And that might be the interpretation, but I sense that's not the one Shakespeare most meant. My interpretation might end up even more controversial than this chapter of this book, really, since a lot of people perhaps want to interpret a romantic notion at the end (my mom knows Shakespeare didn't mean it maternally). However, that would be a pretty big thematic divergence and betrayal, if after every line (from "purest faith unhappily forsworn," to "maiden virtue rudely strumpeted," to "gilded honour shamefully misplac'd"), Shakespeare's meaning coalesced to, "Well, I could never do that to my girlfriend." Not to man-splain what Shakespeare meant, but this is what Shakespeare meant ("sam-splaining" is a distinct form):
>
> The narrator referred to himself as a "beggar born," and he cries for death so as to behold himself "desert" from himself, meaning to "leave" himself (to die) and "leave" all of the tragedies listed thereafter. The last line is exactly parallel to this in meaning. He refers to his love: "I leave *my* love" — his literal, un-metaphorical love — "alone." To leave his love is leaving his body. It's leaving his skin. It's leaving his emotion. Shakespeare is expressing that the immense love within the narrator that he's expressed in the verses of this sonnet, does not deserve the injustice of being escaped alone. Jokingly, one could even interpret he'd rather take you all with him. Perhaps the simplest possible interpretation of the word "love" will be called "simplicity" by academics. The un-metaphorical meaning, the literal one — love — is the meaning I think Shakespeare most meant.

> When a person dies, they don't just leave their life. They leave the constellations of beauty inside them, including all of their love; and this sonnet expresses a tragedy, of someone who has so much love and passion — and it's wasted.
>
> Another interpretation is that his love is tied to a soulmate who he is separated from. I like that interpretation, too, but that would be a fast thematic divergence from the rest of the sonnet.

Here is an excerpt from a suicide note that I wrote, trying to process through the final moments of executing the suicide method, and trying to process how to surmount the thoughts that I found most tried to stop me in my previous attempts:

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> [...]
> 
> Another concern is thoughts of doubt. For example, I might remember how much comfort my mom brings me and that the comfort she offers is still available tomorrow. I might even feel guilty for taking such drastic actions under the wing of such availability of comfort. I think that’s the strongest argument, and the hardest to stay resolved in.
>
> I might remember my grandma, and the injustice that this has fallen on her grandson.
>
> But then I can maybe find peace in those thoughts. Maybe I can imagine my mom and grandma, and grandpa, and all those people who loved me and made me, and love — present tense — in the case of my mom, and find peace in knowing they want my pain to end. That they are not judging me for my exit, and support my escape from this hellhole.
>
> Then I can [method redacted] and try not to think of all the strangers who tainted this world for me. Try to remain meditated on the thought that my family — my mom, my uncle — are good. The world has heart in it. 
> ### $\Huge &#8221;$

That's how the note ended. 

It's expressing a strong belief that the world doesn't have heart, and that the part of it that does wants me to be free of pain, literally, un-metaphorically, seriously.

I didn't share with anybody that I was going to do it. Had I done it, I would've succeeded. Had I shared that I was going to do it, I would've gotten coercively hospitalized and drugged against my will, most likely. If I did it now, I would succeed. If the method were taken away from me, I would succeed, and whoever took it away would directly cause me to exploit the first chance I get, whatever that method may be, then or for the rest of my life, to do it. The method left in my hands, is the only possibility in which I survive.

I talked to my therapist about suicide back in 2022, while I was still allowed to see him (before the University of Rochester's CS department's health insurance price-gouged each session by hundreds of dollars), through completely abstract rhetoric. Anything other than abstract philosophical rhetoric would've risked being hospitalized coercively and drugged against my will again. I talked to him philosophically, but that's not the kind of serious expression I mean should be possible. I don't mean Shakespeare sonnets or radical philosophy, or inevitable ability to go through with it. Those meanings, expressed literally and seriously, even with a plan and concrete immediately-executable method tied to them, not as philosophy or art, but in the words that a person has available to them everyday, shouldn't have institutional coercion, including coercive hospitalization and drugging, as the threat for their speaking.

Sartre, in his play [No Exit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Exit) (wherein there is no exit door from Hell), described in less words than anybody that "Hell is other people," meaning, Hell — not just suffering, but Hell — comes from the societal relationships or lackthereof that we cannot move through, transcend, or escape. A society’s responsibility is to negotiate for the lives of the people who inhabit it, not a person's to give what's left of theirs suffering within an unjust society, not to mention inexpressibly. 

Right To Talk About Suicide Without Hospitalization, Drugging, Or Police Action should be legalized (or rather, standardized, if serious suicide plans that are planned and intended are to be actually prevented).
- A free-speech person might argue, "I support free speech, but if somebody talks about an elaborate plan to commit a murder, police should take action, in order to prevent the murder. In order to prevent the murder." But in the case of suicide, the inability to talk about the plan causes the suicide.
- My Body, My Choice extends also to not having one's body coercively hospitalized and drugged.
- Gun-rights already give people direct access, except with added risk compared to the safer, peaceful methods that require more research ability and skill to carry out singlehandedly.
- Right To Die is distinct from Right To Talk, but the latter doesn't make sense without the former. Any limitation on the actions a person can take also limits their right to talk about it.
- Most of my experience with the medical systems was physician-assisted suicide.

My point is that if we are to prevent literal, un-metaphorical painful realities, we need to be able to hear them.

Message about preferring to die than legal action

I almost said “It makes me want to die” in the [mass email of 10/30/23](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/3-Disproof.md#email-10302023). Thankfully a friend in a group chat of several people suggested otherwise, or else the University of Rochester might’ve been responsible for doing another coerced hospitalization of me, and a repeat of the cycle of unforeseen consequences from involuntary interventions on me. Either way, however, they could have *plausibly* been responsible for a student and worker's suicide.

Rewind to August, before the six-month review deadline and after I was notified of my stipend and advisor-cut. I took my best friend into this, asking for his advice on an email that I sent, and stating my plans (or lackthereof) regarding legal action:

</br>We were discussing [this email (of 08/10/23)](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Not-Enough-Carbs.md).

I sent them this email exactly as I showed my friend. That was the best I was able to phrase everything (for whatever reason, perhaps due to revisiting the trauma, my consciousness and my corresponding linguistics weren't in the best state). All of what had gone on was conveyed to them as early as the beginning of August, at least as much as could be summarized in less than a book. Following which, here is how my best friend and I discussed it afterwards:

# Synchronicities

Meanwhile, before and after, astonishing [synchronicities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity) happened that can be listed below and I leave for your judgement on their metaphysical or coincidental nature.

### Chris Kanan (Deus ex memory)

- Indeed, my faith regarding sending my sincere description of the traumas, despite the difficulty of doing so, was somewhat rewarded, though probably not by their conscious intent, rather by a lucky [“Deus Ex Memory”](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Deus-Ex-Memory.md), wherein one of the 3 committee members (accidentally) recorded to official record that he really-extraordinarily didn’t remember the details of the meeting on which their termination was based.
- Following this [“Deus Ex Memory”](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Deus-Ex-Memory.md) exchange with Chris Kanan, I had yet another reply I wanted to send afterwards that would’ve ruined the conclusive punctuation of the previous, and by chance my internet went down or some disruption to the internet happened after hitting send and I was really lucky that it didn’t go through, leaving this exchange on the note of “we all know what just happened,” and a strong discredit to the committee's judgement-making, thoughtfulness, and memory.
- This is the same Chris Kanan who gave the [one and only concrete research suggestion](), which I ended up following [exceptionally and on proven GitHub record]() before the termination decisions, and didn't just get no credit, but also the judgement that I “refused to follow” committee advice as the justification for the termination decision, despite the advice being disproportionately hard and intense (“invent a new RL systems algorithm before the next meeting”, [paraphrasing]()), and having done it quite extraordinarily really via a novel accelerated parallel priority experience replay with sampling-without-replacement algorithm with memory-mapping, and truly-shared RAM. There was nothing like it, still isn’t, and it’s by far the best RL implementation of experience replay and adjacent sampling algorithms, as well as being novel as an algorithm itself via the sampling-without-replacement, which I described to my advisor’s satisfaction in literally the meeting in which he next notified me of my stipend and advisor-cut, since that was his intent for the meeting.
- The theme of memory is a big coincidence in itself since what I implemented was a large-scale, dynamically growable, rewritable, truly shared RAM and adaptive memory-mapping across devices parallelized lifelong replay memory. [TO DO: Stress this way more]
- I never met Chris Kanan in person and my advisor suggested him as one of the last-minute replacement committee members. Note: I don't think he should be punished for this. I think whatever powers-that-be that regulate his consciousness proved stronger than the ones that facilitate the atmosphere/landscape of the formal University of Rochester, and did good amid impossible programming.

### Jordan Peterson

My benzo trauma was with a [comparatively](https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/10091/benzodiazepine-conversion-calculator) higher dose than what Jordan Peterson took (he took approximately 12% - 80% the dose I did, and that's when I was taking them at the lowest dose the psychiatrists had reduced to), and preceded the situation Mikhaila Peterson, his daughter, described ([originally on her channel](https://youtu.be/lwXHZvyGmRU?si=_1C7x2LY7pCETyAA)), about how the professional psychoanalyst was caught off guard by the severe damages that the drugs caused, wherein he took [0.5 mg](https://ashnavabi.com/2022/01/19/jordan-peterson-was-not-addicted-to-benzos/) of [Clonazepam](https://windwardway.com/rehab-blog/jordan-peterson-finishes-lengthy-treatment-for-addiction/) per day as prescribed, reportedly, and unlike him I didn’t have the entire Russian army brigade bringing me into health (he went to Russia, where they were the first to have the medicine and specialized treatment to help him).

### Mikhaila Peterson

Prior to that, by coincidence, his daughter Mikhaila (thankfully) recommended the steak-only diet (for an independent thing), which is where I heard it from, a clip from her podcast. That’s a global-level synchronicity involving them that happened after I was put through all of this crisis, which contributed to bringing me out, as well as my hair growing back, thanks to her diet recommendation.

### Timing of benzodiazepine coercion [diagram](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/assets/9126603/497f6d9b-ff12-4e6a-97c5-e5230c05e505)

I finished making this [benzo-timeline diagram](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/assets/9126603/497f6d9b-ff12-4e6a-97c5-e5230c05e505) just as Pink Floyd's [Comfortably Numb](https://youtu.be/_FrOQC-zEog?si=riY-TNigVjimQ_iT) started playing on my Spotify's radio on shuffle, a song about a doctor taking a patient named "Pink"'s soul through "medicines" meant to help him. The next song was Psycho Killer which I'll interpret as psychiatric killer. Oh and then Alabama  Song (Whisky Bar). Not bad. Rgearding Whiskey Bar, any song about alcohol is fitting for the topic of benzos, since they both work by GABA as the mechanism of action. In fact, I introduced a fellow hospital-inmate Lily to Elliott Smith for the first time in the hospital with the song [Between the Bars](https://youtu.be/2FmYzACF-kg?si=DLaBako9OolIYuVx) (about alcohol... not about Xanax bars, though Xanax is another benzo and "bars" is the colloquially and sometimes clinically used term for pills of them) while we were in the hospital (linguistically like: between the bars of confinement). It was the only song I thought to show her in the one situation when we were allowed to pick our own music, and she remembered and liked it. Also coincidentally, she was keeping a synchronicity list while we were there. While some of these are clearly just linguistic, the timing of [Comfortably Numb](https://youtu.be/_FrOQC-zEog?si=riY-TNigVjimQ_iT) and the next two songs seems worth noting since many people, like Lily and myself, appreciate synchronicities. Two more: (1) speaking of timing, the [diagram](https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/assets/9126603/497f6d9b-ff12-4e6a-97c5-e5230c05e505) is about a chronology (not of songs, but of benzo trauma), and (2) Lily’s last name is phonetically pronounced "Jung," the depth psychologist who coined synchronicities.

### CMT deletion of record

CMT (the portal that was used to submit to the "NIPS" 2018 conference, today called NeurIPS) deleted their record of my MHDPA innovation paper, the one that foretold ChatGPT to my university's professors (or tried to), the same month when I was terminated (CMT’s deleting of that record at around that time can be verified, since they sent out a notification email on 10/20/23 to everybody that they were updating their data retention policy). But in 2018, the paper was sent out to Henry Kautz and Daniel Gildea by email, and submitted to the class as that class’s end of semester project also via email. So the digital record does remain to verify the paper and its being written in 2018 with the first initial successful experiments, and email record of Henry and Dan's respective advice on how to mathematically or linguistically describe MHDPA, claiming more math was needed and that “relational reasoning” is the wrong term (though what I had and stuck with is now the convention, and already had some precedent then). That’s not to insult Henry or Dan. There’s also clear record that, most deep learning and natural language processing researchers, even outside of the University of Rochester, [weren't too abundantly "foretelling" of MHDPA's importance](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=mhdpa&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C33&as_ylo=2017&as_yhi=2018) (the link is to two papers that were, the earliest papers to use MHDPA at all, also from 2018, and others that just directly referenced it) at the time of my paper. Both of those two papers used MHDPA for something fundamentally new, but neither innovated directly on MHDPA, meaning mine was probably the first to do so, ever. While I was finishing up the code for my MHDPA innovation in Montreal during NeurIPS (called "NIPS" at the time) 2018, I met one of the authors of [one of those two papers](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2018/hash/e2eabaf96372e20a9e3d4b5f83723a61-Abstract.html), Ryan Faulkner, and we got lunch and he said he'd recommend me to a position at DeepMind (he was miraculously impressed with me). 

And not only foretold to my university's professors, but innovated on and executed successful experiments verifying the early innovation — and formal paper submission, later derailed by me having to switch advisors, fields, and put on deadlines, not to mention all of their doubt, skepticism, and lack of enthsuiasm (oh but enthusiasm came later when MHDPA exploded, with Henry even telling me on email record, after he was no longer my advisor, that I should work on vision transformers!).

### Covid

Then Covid interestingly happened when I joined an all-Chinese lab (Chenliang’s). Almost like he was taking vengeance for me.

### Translations and meaning of my last name "Lerman"

 Also wasn’t unfitting given my Taoist practices and interests, which is one of the most peaceful religions on Earth, credited to the Chinese, namely Laozi, not Chenliang, and good translators including Richard Wilhelm, who was German (and my last name “Lerman” is actually of German Ashkenazi root, meaning “teacher,” also a good translator, of ["ancient" wisdom](Philosophy/My-Spirituality.md), [the nature of consciousness](Philosophy/Consciousness.md), [convoluted](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Conv-is-all-you-need.md) AI topics for Chenliang’s somewhat-[convoluted](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Conv-is-all-you-need.md) lab group, [complex math](https://github.com/slerman12/Teaching/blob/master/Other%20materials/Integrals.md), [myth](Philosophy/Cosmogenesis-Myth.md), [chemistry](Philosophy/Fire.md), and now [apparently physics](Philosophy/Velocity-Addition-Formula.md)). 

### Sam "Altman"

The head of OpenAI, the company that invented ChatGPT (that used MHDPA), whose name is "Sam Altman" (mine is Sam Lerman) — "Altman," which is not German Ashkenazi for "teacher" — was terminated as the head of OpenAI in an unusually sensationalized situation exactly 17 days after my termination as PhD student, just in time for my birthday (exactly one day before), then was brought back.

They were working on some AGI project called Q*, and the synchronicity may have been meant to give me hope, but [it didn't](https://github.com/animal-tree/SuspiciousnessofSynchronicitiesAndParanoia/blob/main/Synchronicity-Paranoias.md).

### Michael Scott’s paper factory

Michael’s name [is mockable](https://youtu.be/ZPKdJGY0YyE?si=ja-odwAD_z7G98ZK) (that links to a story arc from The Office, where the main character, Michael Scott, starts his own paper company, much like the academic factory that I was being pressured to publish faster in, except regular papers). 

But from the age of three and two thirds, until 11th grade, as a result of the Uzbek mistranslation when we moved, mine used to be much more mockable. 

As I described to my friend: 

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> These quotes express that I am writing something, but i am aware that this writing is in quotes. Therefore do the quotes bias their own measurement of what is being written? I think so. Lest this paragraph thus far would not be entirely about the quotes.
>
> Anyway, I'm thinking about "Sam" - the name. Did you know, \<friend's name\>, (okay apparently this is a targeted-audience writing-prompt), that my name was Semen until 11th grade? This is new information to you as far as I can recall, but a major part of the story of my life. "story" sounds pretentious and there I go with the quotes again. 
>
> Yes, my name was legitimately, legally "Semen". From the age of 3ish/4 to 11th grade. And every bully and teacher and substitute teacher knew it. No one told me I could get a lawyer let alone a lawyer would do the process of changing the name for free! My mom to this day thinks it wouldn't have been possible before 11th grade, for free anyway. And we were poor. Lower-lower class poor. 
> 
> Maybe a lawyer and court would've sympathized with a kid wanting to change his name from "Semen", maybe not. But of course, it shaped me. Into being the odd weird "semen" that I am today. In actuality, my name is Seamón<sup>$\text{\color{green}[1.]}$</sup> or Soema, or the Americanized: Sim'on or Shimon<sup>$\text{\color{green}[2.]}$</sup>. In Hebrew these names mean wisdom. In the Kabbalistic teachings, two types of wisdom: seeing as the complement to hearing, hearing as the complement to seeing. I think I mentioned this already. I won't rehash but something something new paragraph.
>
> Anyway, I like Sam. Because Sam in all the fantasies and mythos' of modern time means "innocence." "Samwell", "Samwise", "Sam". It means "this person has a wisdom, but from the good of his heart, not his intelligence." It means "this person is naive, but he has a good heart." I like the name Sam. "Shimon" means "this person is wise through his intelligence." It's true, but it's not me all the time as you know. I like "Sam" though.
> ### $\Huge &#8221;$

$\text{\color{green}[1.]:}$ I think "Siímyon" might be the best spelling.

$\text{\color{green}[2.]:}$ My Rabbi, who I hadn't met before 2022, actually told me this. He designated me as "Shimon," and told me that "Shimon" means "to hear" in Kabbalistic teachings. In Kabbalistic teachings, "to hear" is the complement to "to see." It's the second way of knowing. To hear is to understand, it's to fine out the meaning from the varied knowings, whereas "to see" is to know — it’s the sense or awareness of truth; no teaching needed. My mom being a music theory professor in Samarkand when I was born, I find it meaningful if this was my birth name, though really it had nothing to do with the Kabbalistic interpretation. My great-aunt’s late husband was named Siímyon. When my kindergarten teacher truncated my mistranslated name to "Sem," it became "Sam," which is also synchronistic to where I was born, Samarkand. I'm not gonna make a second-cumming pun though. The real twist about my name, has to do with my physics method, and my grandma's father, TBA (all the clues haven’t been left yet, but people can figure it out in a Jon-Snow type way when the remaining clues are specified).

### "Life ruined" post, entire-forum being deleted 5 months after I emailed it to the faculty/administrators 

Description [after having shown it to Niaz who commented in person about it (and to faculty/administrators), and writing BrokenWisdoms as a result of the depression and fear that came from losing my only description of those events, one I hadn’t backed up anywhere, with comments from others about having experienced similar things, the trauma of benzodiazepine addiction/coercion, and expressing extreme sympathy, and it was the top post in that for 4-ish years running]

### Physics

Revelatory insights about the universe as a differentiable brain in my 2nd year, with that fascination returning to me regularly and intensely thereafter. Then in my 3rd/4th year, a 5-minute but-urgent/vivid/visceral conversation with my uncle (an optics physicist, about applying deep learning models to his work, involving optics, including behavior of light, for my PhD) just before — by chance — being put on the XRD (meaning, light diffraction) project by Chenliang, and, since being terminated, me coming up with a [unified wave theory](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff-2/blob/main/Theories/Unified-Wave-Theory.md) (involving a differentiable, intelligence-optimizable, simulation/model of the universe) showing the agreement of my wave theory with measurement primarily through light multi-slit diffraction (analogous to XRD) experiments.
