## Part 1 

- **University-provided health insurance (Aetna)**
- **University-hospital doctor**
- **University-owned drug deliverer**

In the summer prior to my first year as a PhD student, my university-hospital doctor Lisa Beck prescribed a medication called Dupilumab. It's a biologic agent that you inject into your stomach that laser-targets a specific antibody associated with eczema. My eczema was severe and debilitating. Some time into taking the medication — I think maybe 8 months — my university-provided health insurance Aetna cut me off from the drug without warning. I wasn't notified by Aetna or my doctor, or the university-owned hospital, but by the university-owned intermediary deliverer, who was responsible for delivering the drug on a recurring basis to my doorstep, since it can't — or at least at the time couldn't — be provided for pick-up at a pharmacy. They called me and told me they couldn't reach my doctor, but for some reason Aetna had decided to no longer cover the prescription. I remember walking up and down Mt. Hope Avenue with my phone in a panic calling my doctor trying to reach her, and the university deliverer telling me they were trying to do the same and couldn't reach her either. After a while, my hair started falling out rapidly. I have no genetic predisposition to baldness, from any side of my family. The abnormally rapid hair loss was obviously due to the dependency and cessation. 

Though it fell out quickly, I didn't notice at first. The shower drains were filled with hair every day, and I thought it was maybe my housemate's girlfriend's. I didn't get to see my doctor until later in the Spring, a long time after, when I think much of the side and top of my head were bald. She diagnosed it as Alopecia Areata as a result of the sudden cessation of Dupilumab. To be clear, she diagnosed it as Alopecia Areata as a result of the sudden cessation of Dupilumab. She and her nurse took pictures and stored them in the university-hospital computers. 

Eventually, she sorted out things with the university-provided health insurance, but by then it was too late. Most of my hair had fallen out.

We finally got a delivery of the drug. I wasn’t sure whether it’d be safer at that point to re-instigate the dependency/addiction or avoid the drug at all costs.

Here's a personal story, since I was fixated with Taoism at the time:

To help me weigh the difficult decision — and it was difficult because that medication was extremely potent and didn't even help my eczema much, and I believed my hair would grow back — I asked the I Ching. Here I'll describe the hexagrams I got because I find it interesting that one of the predictions came true, and this might be medically useful since it corresponded thrice with my hair growing back (all three resurgences after the Alopecia Areata had developed into Alopecia Universalis, meaning after every piece of hair from my body had fallen out).

The I Ching "answered" it didn’t matter which of the two paths I chose ("The town may be changed, / But the well cannot be changed. / It neither decreases nor increases." - "The Well", unchanging). (Maybe an interesting observation: that the English "well" is phonetically similar to "wellness," as well). It also had previously "answered" my hair would grow back of its own accord, which it did, temporarily. I still remember: "Difficulty at the beginning" (as Richard Wilhelm described: "The name of the hexagram, Chun, really connotes a blade of grass pushing against an obstacle as it sprouts out of the earth — hence the meaning, 'Difficulty at the beginning'.") $\rightarrow$ (changes to) "Fellowship with man" (e.g., baldness). That answer about whether my hair’d grow back came true with the steak-only diet (steak is "manly" and so that again ties to the hexagram symbolism of "Fellowship with man"), almost like a suggestion for how my hair could "sprout" out of the earth, my head, like blades of grass, again… which it did, temporarily but covering my entire head except for an unnoticeable patch at the top of my scalp.

Then all the hair fell out again. Again, total baldness. No eyelashes, eyebrows, or hair.

Another time I did the steak-only diet, my pubic hair fully grew back — temporarily.

Another time I did the steak-only diet, a few eyelashes grew back for the first time. 

That can’t be a coincidence, so I leave this story here both for medical utility and for the understanding that [I now look like Gollum](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10211230008185126&set=a.1273659620707) because of medical malpractice.

> By the way, the scariest nightmare I ever had, over and over that whole night, was the day I injected Dupilumab the first time. I remember my housemate at the time in the other room and I wanted to wake him. That's how scared I was. The nightmare was of a tall skinny slenderman, who kept approaching to rape me. Every time I closed my eyes and fell asleep, he'd reappear. Again and again, for that whole night. I never had a nightmare like that before. It was vivid.

<!-- <br><i><b>Note:</b> I finished making this diagram just as Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb" started playing on my Spotify, a song about a doctor taking a patient named "Pink"'s soul through "medicines" meant to help him.

Any song about alcohol is fitting for the topic of benzos, since they both work by GABA as the mechanism of action. In fact, I introduced a fellow hospital-inmate Sarah to Elliott Smith for the first time with the song "Between the Bars" (about alcohol... not about Xanax bars [Xanax is another benzo and "bars" is the colloquially and sometimes clinically used term for pills of them]) while we were in the hospital (between the bars of confinement). Since she was keeping a synchronicity list while we were there, I think she'll appreciate these observations in this caption when I show her, though it would unfortunately be a non-sequitor to make any claims to their nature or significance. Some of these however are just linguistic.</i> -->

## Part 2

- **University-hospital psychiatrists**
- **University outpatient doctor**
- **University-hospital police officers**

This is going to be hard. What the fuck can I say? I was going to exclude this whole section. This is night-marish and you should be scared. Oh friendly psychiatrist pops in to tell me that they can't stop the benzodiazapine coercion. No, that's not the beginning...

Eczema leads to hair loss leads to depression and worsening psychiatric state…

### House on May St.

My hair fell out while I lived in *my house on May St.*, a miraculous situation where the landlord — who I’d never met previously — rented me a 4-bedroom nice antique house near both the university and the park in Rochester where the Lilac Festival is held, to myself, for $600/month, starting Fall, 2017 — well, technically one bedroom from that house, but I had the whole place to myself pretty much for the next year, and even furnished at least one other bed from another room since, inexplicably and literally miraculously, the landlord didn't believe he could find anyone on his own without my help to rent out to, and he wanted grad students. 

It was beautiful, and even had a porch and balcony, big kitchen, a freezer for big-game hunting (this detail becomes funny later), basement, dishwasher, and laundry machine. Of some of the PhD students who visited me, some needed housing, and later the landlord and I showed them around the rooms (maybe not even prior to me furnishing any of the other bedrooms, which the landlord didn't mind that I'd done, seeing as my best friend and I also beautifully furnished that whole house together during one of my best friend's visits early when I moved in, really beautifully, and that increased the value of the house more, in addition to the sofa and tables and furnishings and beds and desks that the landlord provided — did I mention the word "miraculous" yet?), and one of them even mentioned to the landlord at the end having the funds to pay the full year's rent already — I don't remember why they ended up not moving in, but that was also clearly miraculous. I did end up renting out the attic (which was like a studio apartment, well, a giant room) to one of my friends from high school for the landlord after maybe 4 months of having the place to myself, and even then it was pretty much entirely my house, though he also set up a DJ station for himself in the basement since he threw raves (not in the house), and had his girlfriend over, but he kept quiet, and he wasn't a grad student, but the landlord had a strong belief in my judgement — again, a miraculous thing.

Pets weren't allowed, but that's okay, because there was a [semi-adopted stray who regularly came to visit me outside and sat with me on (or near) my porch named "Batman" (according to his collar)](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/KXoyjpZeM6tsKRrE/), and I loved him very much if the video doesn't make that clear.

Months before I moved out, I became the admin/moderator of the [university Facebook housing page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1112684565415024/) by chance, because the actual admin posted he was looking for a student to moderate the page for him, and I responded that I could do it. My landlord didn't know (and probably still doesn't) that I'm the effective-admin/moderator of that page. Also, since then, I've messaged the manager/admin of that group multiple times to give the moderation to someone else or moderate it himself and he hasn’t replied, and doesn't appear to use Facebook, so hereforth I'm permitting myself to call myself the admin. I’m glad to moderate, but not super good at keeping up to date with it. So, after there was no chance left of getting to keep the place to just myself and friend longer, I ended up finding University of Rochester grad students to fill all 4 bedrooms of the house, and all 4 bedrooms of the neighboring house, also belonging to the landlord — I think "semi-detached home" is what it's called — and, thanks to the ad I ended up posting ([here it is](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbe5ceff-3b06-4582-97fb-c13c30d00564)), I redirected inquiries to my landlord's email and my landlord's email flooded with other PhD students looking to fill that house, including one of the ones who’d originally wanted and planned to who I'd notified (he moved into the attached one). I ended up adding my landlord to that page, where, technically I'm not supposed to allow landlords, only students. Sorry for this phrasing, but the landlord’s house is now "never lacking" in interested grad students looking to rent from him. In fact, lucky for him, the neighboring commercial building is now [a herbal apothecary](https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2019/09/19/little-apothecary-becomes-little-herbary-south-ave-rochester-ny/2365775001/), since it was abandoned when I lived there (due to, if I recall correctly, a murder, though I didn't know that moving in).

I also grew out a full beard (except a really small patch probably from a lifetime of topical eczema creams, as my pediatrician told me was happening in high school or college) and full mustache in those first months I lived in that May St. house, based on some intuition, that I shaved on December 15th, 2017 (since it was the day my best friend [visited me](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/c7m83bHR5v1mP4p4/) at that house and encouraged me to shave it; the fact that we went to the friend's rave that day, who would later move in with me, was also a coincidence) some months before Aetna cut me off from the prescription to Dupilumab, but it was the first time I ever grew out my facial hair. [Here's a picture with my family at that house from my 22nd birthday](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d1d366e-14bd-49cd-9a58-dca108e9a144), not too long after I started to grow it out.

I was working really hard in that house, developing my long-term memory research ideas and implementing the code for it there, meditating every day while practicing strict dietary (Paleo) disciplines, while working on campus taking full semesters of grad-level classes, and at the University of Rochester's Medical Center, building neural models to predict the progression of Parkinson's disease, and that house is where I started to get my idea for how stochasticity in the universe's quantum mechanics could explain a mechanism for "God" or some intelligent power in nature, hypothetically.

I was sleeping in one of the second bedrooms, when, on a rare occasion, my housemate friend and his girlfriend woke me climbing up the stairs. Somehow I had a sudden realization, near around 3 AM or whatever time it was in that night, that the universe's particles might be random, and therefore can be shifted by slight standard deviations by an intelligence — like the biological kind (or modeled by the artificial kind) — in such a way that still respects the known laws of physics and yet permits the possibility of an intelligent nature, that can modulate how those particles are sampled with respect to the sampling distributions.

In that house, somewhat before, and thereafter (continuing for years, mostly without pause), I was practicing many disciplines, including meditation, Paleo diet, and ascetic disciplines. I learned the Transcendental Meditation (TM) technique from an instructor, while living there. The instructor I learned from through the TM program was trained directly by the creator/translator of the technique, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the guru/yogi the Beatles infamously learned their meditation practice from. I experienced the subtle sinking/melting of my state of consciousness, including visceral physiological sensations, perhaps what some people have observed/called as "Kundalini," that I hadn't heard of yet and came to from Googling my physical sensations, that felt as though they were a movement in my esophagus, trachea, or into my third eye, incredibly visceral and physical. The meditation brought my consciousness to a sublime state and alleviated my social anxiety.

Later, after some time without that "Kundalini" sensation, I described how I theorized TM might work to another skeptical PhD student, my friend Mohsen, who'd actually visited me in that house and met "Batman" once, but on a hiking/camping/kayacking/hotel trip much later in the Adirondacks and Niagra Falls, that it had something to do with the distribution of processing systems in the brain. For example: attenuating to a mantra, reduces other area attention activity such that unconscious thinking processes can be allocated. However, while still in the house on May St., I had a different philosophy, involving relational reasoning and long-term memory — one that I would say is more accurate —  but I can't remember what it was. I have notes in a small red journal (not a reference to Jung's "Red Book," but I was reading Jung at the time) [here](). To do: find journal and link photos

It was in that house when Aetna cut me off from Dupilumab and my hair started falling out.

After that house, I moved in with my mom to our apartment, where I came up with my [MHDPA innovation paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgmmzgsrctmg#6cd1b9) (the method underlying ChatGPT) in 2018, and it was in the middle of wrapping up that that I was hospitalized. It was actually in the first hospitalization, at RGH, where I ran the successful experiments for that paper, since the hospital staff had allowed my mom to bring in my laptop. It was in the second hospital, at the University of Rochester’s Strong Hospital, where I described relational reasoning to my brother-in-law and showed that paper to my fellow inpatient, Sarah (real name used with permission).

### Psychosis, and Rochester General Hospital (RGH)

About 5 - 8 months after the hair loss, on Christmas Eve, 2018, I had a psychotic episode (no prior history, not even of mania) that was diagnosed as a "manic episode" (but in my "opinion," by an ordinary psychiatric definition, was "psychotic" since the two days of it prior to the hospitalization involved: 

- God telling me "He" was going to kill my mom if I didn’t circumcise myself;
- circumcising myself;
  - I got a clamp iron, and — how to describe the other tool I used? —
  - "saw knife" might not be what it’s called,
  - a kitchen knife with really toothy edges that by all expectations should’ve sliced through with the full strength I was sawing it down by;
  - I think "God" figured "good enough" after that, seeing as all my strength was used, and blood was over the kitchen floor;
  - I cleaned up the blood with paper towels;
- then God telling me "He" was going to kill my mom if I didn’t go somewhere, and that being near my mom was going to drain her and kill her because of the — I don't know what to call it, transcendent, spiritual, schizophrenic — state I was in;
- staying in the woods in the freezing snow all day and night;
- "God" telling me I had to stay there for a week;
- "God" telling me to choose — "up" or "down" — with a throat movement situation that I sensed — where "up" meant "power" and "siding with men" and "down" meant siding with my mom, and I chose down and kept choosing down;
- "God" commanding me to put a stick in my butt while threatening to kill my mom, so I did that as well in the woods, uncomfortably, since I can’t even tolerate my own finger there;
  - incidentally, this was all on Christmas, Christmas Eve to Christmas morning/night, but hopefully this context makes clear that I had nothing to do with that, and though this doesn't help my case to add, I barely knew it was Christmas since my family is Jewish and we don't celebrate;
- "God" telling me my mom was drowning in the freezing brook;
- me jumping in the freezing brook to save my mom who the whole time I thought was dying, and now thought was drowning in the brook;
- me crawling out of the freezing brook feeling unable to move due to the cold, as I envisioned that my mom was dead having drowned, smiling at me with deep defeat from beyond the realms of consciousness, and that I was going to resurrect as my paralyzed wheelchair-bound neighbor who got registered as a sex-offender because of internet child porn, who depended on his 80-something year-old mom to take care of him to function, who smelled like pee, who constantly made our whole apartment hallway reek of pee, and who was an alcoholic, a Ukranian man in his 50s named Volyoda who, interestingly, ended up dying later that subsequent year in a psychosis revolving around his mom dying; and — resuming the part about me — 
- me then screaming for the ambulance to a full moon in the woods, my voice randomly and suddenly sounding insincere;
- my pants had fallen partially down my legs when I had crawled out of the brook and God "told me" not to adjust them on faith;
- the ambulance then finding me like that at around maybe 3 AM or 4 AM, wet from the brook water and possibly hypothermic with pants partially down though they pulled them up quickly as they carried me up to the ambulance, and bringing me to the hospital;
- however, I didn’t share any of those details;
- "God told me" to tell the ambulance responders that I was in there "for pleasure" on a faith regarding my pants that had partially fallen over my boxers and the sex-offender resurrection vision, which I did;
- and that was all I told the ambulance responders or the first nurses about what happened — "for pleasure";
- my legs were thawed in some machine and my mom arrived and I was still afraid she was going to die, but I didn’t say anything;
- a nurse, and I think no one else, saw and remarked on the slice/gash on my foreskin;
- the foreskin eventually healed, and that is a miracle;
- [add details about frostbite/hypothermia situation from MyChart, which notably includes nothing about any of the details of the psychosis, including circumcision]).

There was a Santa Clause who showed up. He wanted to say hi. It was odd. (The ambulance driver had a big bushy white beard that only now, as I’m remembering, do I sense some irony of humor about his rather out of the ordinary decision to visit me in the hospital room to check in, like coming off his ambulance sleigh to wish me a sardonic Christmas). 

- Then, after they dragged me to another room, I felt some strange thing happen with my tongue and throat, like my tongue was going back into it;
- I went into a conscious catatonia and stayed still due to a "command from God" to do so, even as the doctors, who thought I was unconscious, chatted about me being "Jesus" bullying/sarcastically while they dragged my body to the MRI machine;
- I’d kind of intimately shaken hands with the police officers prior to the catatonia, so I think that’s what triggered that bullying;
- there was a lot of confusion after the catatonia, so the information about my foreskin didn’t pass from nurse 1 to people N, or else "mania" wouldn’t have been the diagnosis, and more questions would’ve been asked;
- that nurse was just there to help thaw my legs to prevent hypothermia and frostbite;
- then my sister arrived and touched my arm and told the doctor that I was conscious because she saw my small smile in my eyes when she did that — not like an insincere smile, a smile because I desperately needed that love and warmth, and was afraid;
  - I felt like a buzzing spark when Marina touched my arm;
- and the doctor reassured her that I wasn’t (conscious);
- the "catatonia" might've not been catatonia since it stemmed from a conscious cognitive delusion, in which I was obeying a yogic-type control of my body, but which did not immobilize me if I made the cognitive choice to surrender the obedience, which I didn't, because I was afraid that my mom was going to die if I did;
- "God" telling me to wait like that for three days, with my jaw clenched;
  - this detail also doesn't get shared with anyone;
- a couple days later, benzos brought me out of the pseudo-catatonia;
- I also gave the "for pleasure" answer to the psychiatrist, who diagnosed me with a manic episode and catatonia;
- the nurses there were delicate and gentle;
- then RGH discharged me one week later.

> [!NOTE]
> I'm actually proud of that psychosis because it proved how much I'd do to save a person's life, at least my mom's anyway.

I felt, ever since that sensation that my tongue was going back into my throat, some vestibular situation — something really changed, and has been different since. That oceanic feeling that John Lennon captured really well about his experiences with TM in the song ["Across the Universe"](https://youtu.be/90M60PzmxEE?si=2n0PJKmeekYA6etl) ([this might be esoteric, but that song's lyrics John Lennon had written about TM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Across_the_Universe#Composition)) was gone. Since that "catatonia" (tongue-throat situation), my experiences/words during and following TM weren't "like endless rain into a paper cup." They had become coarse somehow, and instead of that vibrant "Kundalini" movement I felt before, there was a physical feeling in my neck, a right-angle tilt, even when I wasn't meditating. I first began noticing this while trying to meditate in the hospital at RGH.

- **More than two weeks since the first hospitalization**, I end up not sleeping all night; 
- my sister happened to visit the next day;
- due to having not slept all night, she was worried I might be going through another manic episode and insisted to my mom and me to drive me to **the University of Rochester’s Strong Hospital;**
- **the doctors there didn't question the prior mania nor catatonia, nor ask for any further details about that earlier hospitalization or the events that led up to it;**
- **I was there because my sister was worried.**

### The unsampled world at Clover St.

My sister came to our apartment and brought my mom and I to her dark-red mid-size crossover, that I thought looked like a car the hypothetical Devil would drive. Compared to the cars my mom and I drove, it was much newer, much nicer. She was working as a nurse at the time and making a middle class income. My mom was working two jobs, and I was a doctoral student.

When we were driving, I remember we stopped at Clover St., due to a red light, and some instinct told me to jump out. The feeling was ominous. But together with that ominous feeling, as the drive progressed, I sensed that a million worlds existed, and that all of them had evolved to converge to this one. So I sat somewhat reassured, in an uneasy anxiety, that what was happening will be okay. 

Except, the sense/vision/idea was wrong, this time. Instead of my fanciful ideas about quantum stochasticity in a single universe, I had this bizarre idea, specifically on this transit, about "Many worlds" — I know, how original. "Many worlds" is a standard interpretation in quantum physics, often an alternative to Copenhagen which also, like me, both usually and I guess in my version here, tends to assume a single universe.

In “Many worlds," or at least my version that I was conjuring up in my mind in the car, or I should say was pouring into my mind through just sheer awareness, everything that happened in the universe was evolved, through countless cycles of different trajectories, over cosmogenesis origins upon cosmogenesis origins, into the perfect exact happenings that were happening then. Now that's not really “Many worlds." That's one world, where it just cycles many times, and we just happen to be in the version that cycled in this way.

"Many worlds" is more nuanced. It says: there's a LOT of worlds — like at least 6. No, maybe a million. No, googolplex. Infinity! Undefined! And we're in this one, because "reasons."

Both of these theories/interpretations are wrong. But neglecting to explain why for now, I think either of these serve as an accessible way to quickly show that, even under a pretty standard physics interpretation, the possibility of "God" is not... I think the word I want to use is "not necessarily stupid."

I mentioned stochasticity in the universe's quantum mechanics. That means randomness. The universe, as it's theorized today, is fundamentally probabilistic. And physics does a great job of telling us that those probabilities are probabilities. No no, just look at Schrödinger’s quantum wave function. See, it's a bunch of probability densities that splash around like a kiddie pool. And when those waves are especially high, that's where the particle is more likely to get sampled, or that's the more likely velocity of the particle, or that's the more likely “World" that gets sampled, or in my especially terrible vision, that's the "Cycle" that the universe just permanently converges to forever. 

So where can "God" fit into any of those interpretations, besides the last one being just "Godawful," no-pun-unintended (my puns are deterministic)? Well, ultimately, something has to select which world gets chosen. One way that could happen is through just the magic power of randomness. Another way, is that some *will* known as "standard deviation" is able to allocate the probable from the improbable, and, within its holy bounds, tilt the scales a bit. The "Sampler" — who is the "Sampler"?

I sensed an ominous feeling as we were driving, and that same inner sense that gave me that kind-of vision about the many cycling-evolving worlds converging to this moment’s exact perfection, told me to make a run for it when we stopped at Clover St., at a red light. My doctoral advisor, Henry, actually lived on Clover St.

My sister’s car was big and red, like a giant Dirt Devil, and before we got into it, I immediately had the "Devil" association, appear like a fear in my mind, the first omen (ominous sense) of that drive. Well, the "Sampler" that was about to sample my fate could only have been a little red vacuum cleaner, because, this transit, not specifically just this transit but this transit as well, was taking me to Hell, and the Devil drive did not end on Clover St., nor on the hospital grounds. No, each ticking moment from the drive to the psychiatric unit, even back to home, was a cruise controlled, speed-limit-obeying, insidious, maybe even pleasant drive, deeper, into Hell, to a Hell of mind that only one door leaves.

But at this time, we were stopped on Clover St. And there was my doctoral advisor’s big house, on this street, that I could’ve, hypothetically, run to, in one of the many other worlds. 

My advisor, Henry Kautz, was the most successful man I knew, and his house, I thought, was a mansion (though honestly the one I had on May St. probably would've been preferable).

As my sister must’ve thought, I’d be getting just standard quality care. What a lucky day. What a lucky world that was sampled. And then we proceeded, from Clover St., to the first day of my benzo nightmare. 

### Psychiatrists at the University of Rochester's Strong Hospital

I'm 5'5" 110lb.

I had a prescription for benzos before, but for social anxiety, in which I took $\frac{1}{4}$ to $\frac{1}{2}$ of a milligram before, during the time when I took them at all, spacing out dosages usually by at least two weeks, and that had side effects.

I had to stay there for a month and they forced me to take 48x that dosage reduced later to 12x that dosage, over the course of 3 times per day, every day. Think about that. $\frac{1}{4}$ to $\frac{1}{2}$ of a milligram, once every two weeks at most, had side effects. $48\text{x}$ $-$ $12\text{x}$ that dosage, but every day.

Accounting for dosage *and* rate, that’s a minimum $336\text{x}$ $-$ $84\text{x}$ &nbsp; to &nbsp; $672\text{x}$ $-$ $168\text{x}$ increase.

For the first three or so weeks, I was high. Then the fog rolled in. The chemical waterboarding was taking effect.

([This link opens to a video with a different medical philosophy. It's worth clicking on, no matter one's skepticisms or feelings about the standard systems.](https://youtu.be/CFtsHf1lVI4?si=c7HOzpchsB2NeP1-))

I was also on antipsychotics, starting from RGH, but the remainder of this book will not be a dissection of antipsychotics, since the benzos were added on top of them, making the judgement of their efficacy compared to the damage from benzos hard to disentangle. The rest of this will be about the experience that was most-plausibly caused by the benzos. 

### Benzodiazepine ("benzos") mechanism of action

This diagram is an original understanding of the  computational neuron with a differentiable analog implemented <a href="https://github.com/slerman12/UnifiedMLold2/tree/master/Blocks/Architectures/LermanBlocks/BioNeuron">here</a>. 

Here is a [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i5hS2iDVuo24PnGicvn5dIZYXUzDfPAl/view?usp=share_link) I made on the topic.

Let's begin a simplified explanation of the brain's neuron. Neurons are cells that are connected to one each other by dendrites and axons that pass chemical messengers from one neuron to downstream neurons. The two most common chemical messengers in the brain are the excitatory neurotransmitter Glutamate and the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Excitatory means they cause the next neuron to also release their neurotransmitters ("fire"). Inhibitory means they lower the voltage activity of the next neuron such that the next neuron is subdued. GABA is the mechanism of action of alcohol. People think alcohol is "disinhibitory," that it "disinhibits" them, but the reality is alcohol is actually inhibitory. It confuses GABA receptors into activating, causing an inhibition of that neuron and all the neurons in your brain. It's a system-wide drug that indiscriminately simulates GABA throughout every part of your brain, from the Occipital lobe, where your eyes see (in the back of your head), to the frontal lobe, where your brain thinks it thinks.

Benzos are GABA agonists, like alcohol. That means they simulate GABA or enhance GABA receptor function. In response, the brain downregulates GABA production and receptor sensitivity universally across the brain, universally, from the parts that are understood to the parts that almost entirely aren't, including some of the most important regions of intelligence whose healthy metric level of functioning is extremely hard to measure behaviorally, clinically, and longitudinally across variants of factors, and necessary for quality living, e.g., the hippocampus responsible for long-term memory. Alcohol does this too, but humans have provably evolved natural mechanisms of recovering from small doses of alcohol thanks to fermented fruit existing in nature. Benzos seem like a Godsend, a Panacea, especially since you're less likely to feel a headache the next day from them for the same effect, but the evidence isn't strong enough to support they're better than alcohol. From what I've gathered, benzos are worse. Since it's somewhat relevant, [here](https://youtu.be/TEKgesBVTJ0?si=OtXQYMZgVd3Qu36M) is a video I made on evolutionary algorithms in deep learning.

Nobody understands this mechanism. To understand this mechanism, you'd have to solve all of neurology and artificial intelligence, and psychiatrists definitely haven't. Benzos are a floodbath of GABA, and your brain responds to those GABA bursts by "downregulation," even long, long after cessation.

### Hospitalization

#### Sarah

After the Christmas, 2018 trauma, I wasn’t able to access my meditation anymore. The mystical phenomenon I physically sensed was stunted. Those Kundalini sensations, and the complete transcendence of my psyche, stopped. 

It was like the breath that had been passing through my system had gotten locked into some bigger entity, that was asymmetrical, overly strong, and just leaning to one side. 

The meditation still relaxed me. I still felt less social anxiety afterwards. It still gave my thoughts more peace. But physically, it felt neither like bliss nor like a body part that I directly controlled. I couldn’t maneuver the breath, kundalini, blood circulation, whatever it was, through the different areas of my physical psyche, and my given mantra, that I repeated silently in my mind as part of the meditation, didn’t carry itself to the same places of silent acuity that it naturally and effortlessly did before, where rather than the hard sensation of speaking my inner voice that now characterizes my mantra’s audition, the mantra had before "melted," "sunk," become so soft until it literally couldn’t be heard and all of my thoughts were then fully adherent to both my will and my natural rhythm, yet silently, and no energy was lost no matter how verbosely or viscerally I thought then, and each one came like "endless rain into a paper cup," where just the right word, or visual or association, corresponded to both my will and my rhythm, and beautifully, organically, and sometimes orgasmically/anxiously/blissfully. It was on that plane of consciousness [that I wrote this paper.](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgmmzgsrctmg#6cd1b9) 

[People mention the "inner monologue" vs. other types of thinking debate](https://www.iflscience.com/people-with-no-internal-monologue-explain-what-its-like-in-their-head-57739). That is a good analogy to the kind of consciousness transition I did while meditating, where my thoughts had become increasingly more acute, and were at the end, both. Both an awareness independent of words and words that perfectly matched that awareness, no matter how deep or intricate, then. And the awareness itself could carry far more information, and with each word, like "endless rain into a paper cup," less energy was used and no exhaustion would arise.

Now, some big lump pushed to the right of my throat, that same moving fist that was once an acute breath which circulated my chest, back, and trachea (or heart, throat, and back of throat), and that later "God" was bringing "up" and "down" and telling me that "down" was "receptive" and would side with my mom, that "up" would side with men and power. 

The fist is now lodged in my throat, to this day. My meditation experiences have not returned to their consistently repeated reproducibly transcendent form from when I lived in the House on May St. The change began in RGH, not during the psychosis. The change began after they injected me with something, rapidly changed the fine balance of my body’s energies, and overwhelmed the sensitivity of a delicate state of consciousness with a much harder, much stronger, much less acute hospital one. The sudden change, including environmental and neurological, as they also "snapped me out" of that state rapidly with the injection of benzos, perhaps broke some endocrine or vestibular system of chakras and Kundalini that is unknown to (modern) science and medicine, locking my throat "chakra" in some way that I since haven’t been able to unlock, again. An Adam’s Apple, now lodged in my throat, like I choked on the wisdom that the higher nature forces gave me, from the House on May St., up to the inexplicable rapid psychosis when I was finishing up my MHDPA paper in 2018. 

Part of what makes thoughts expressive through words is the intuitive feeling of some words as capturing the meaning and evoking some sense of the meaning. The brain makes those associations, and the faster it does so in line with our own will and rhythm, the more harmonious the mental state feels. But its suggestions can also take a life of their own, and after the House on May St., I found I was listening to intuitions that pointed to less rationalizable actions, with the awareness of their physical, visceral appearance in my consciousness and psyche; and so, in tandem with the profoundness of my research and research realizations, about long-term memory, relational reasoning and MHDPA, stochasticity in physics, there was no rational doubt that some profound consciousness phenomenon was being unlocked in tune with the context of what I was studying, and that gave that phenomenon — those intuitions and physical observations — unusual, perhaps even unprecedented, credibility. And I increasingly obeyed the guidance of them, less with my own intent, and more with the adherence to their "grace," their "wind," their threat. 

That is how "God" talked to me during my psychosis. 

Additionally, I was using the I Ching, and the I Ching gave extraordinarily precise answers, answers that were too specific and relevant to be accident. In Rorschach tests, a person looks at ink blots and tells the psychoanalyst their associations. Dream interpretations are similar. But the answers I was getting from the I Ching weren’t just associatively relevant. They were specific, consistent, and profound. 

So besides a consciousness component, I interpreted physical phenomena to be happening in the universe’s physics, as I’d theorized earlier about the intelligence of quantum sampling. So not only did I have the visceral phenomena, and the intelligence research studies, but also direct answers from a randomness-dependent query book, and a rational mechanism for how such actual interventions in the universe — while still respecting the predictable laws of physics currently known to science — could be possible. 

That made the threats infinitely times more convincing, and as I transitioned from the House on May St., where I had independence and self respect, to my apartment without hair, without eyebrows and eyelashes, with even my fingernails purple and bending out of my nails, and social isolation and heavy workloads, including auxiliary ones that my advisor made me do like applying to the NSF GRFP (for which I got a rare "honorable mention," all excellent reviews, one of them even writing, ["This is exactly the type of high-risk, high-reward research that the NSF is looking for to support,"](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87ef2c97-c1d5-4333-9247-a0d28a689efb) except one that gave me a "good" instead of "excellent" because I didn’t have any publications to back up the peer-reviewed credibility of the research I was proposing, research that was about long-term memory primarily, but also relational reasoning and persistent memory), the "vibe" of my status as a person was marginalizing and "Gollum-esque," as I hid in a cave essentially, my last hairs dropping from my head, and worked. 

That "vibe" then commanded me in different ways. Rather than a social energy (or self respecting one, since I wasn't too social in the House on May St. either, and was also working really hard, but in a wealthier surroundings, with park and nearby nature and magical-cat-visitor and antiqueness in the aesthetic, to boot), the creativity of the energy went towards work, and the rest of it gradually became something else. I don’t want to describe it as anxiety. The anxiety appeared later, on that Christmas, 2018 day when I thought my mom was going to die, but until then it was beautiful, scary, but beautiful. 

It was literally a wind that pushed me into the woods. 

I had left my apartment thinking my heightened energies were draining my mom, and walked through the snow aimlessly, but adhering to those grace guidances, to make a distance from her. Then I reached a road near Target, and then I turned towards the woods direction, and last second, I saw a man coming out of his car, and I shouted "Hey!" and I asked him if he had gloves, and he did and he gave them to me. 

Then, still not knowing I was going into the woods, a wind pushed me. A wind blew and I walked into those woods where I sat, in meditative silence, and peace, near a prettier part of the brook, thinking I had to stay there for a week, and if I did, my mom wouldn’t die. 

And I stayed there, completely immune to the cold, but protected, physiologically, by a single coat, sweatpants, and those gloves that were given me. 

Somehow, from the moment I'd left my apartment door, to the rest of this venture, except for a health concern, the cold didn’t feel too cold. My body, in this energy state, adapted so well, that I cannot tell you the medical implications of how much power the body has, as humans have evolved mostly in the Ice Age, and I was there, from the early morning I left to the rest of the day, in the cold, that through this extreme, "psychotic," transcendent energy state didn’t faze me in the slightest, didn’t bite the way cold is thought to supposed to, and it varied — you see, every disobedience to the guidance of my energy state resulted in a physical grasp of me by the cold; I would shiver and shake, at increasingly extreme levels the more I stopped adherence. But as soon as I returned to adherence, the cold and the shaking stopped. 

This is not trivial. This reproducibly felt like a physical relationship between me and the cold, where had I disobeyed the exact adherence of my psychic state, the particles of the cold would (or I should say "did") get me. The shaking then wouldn’t even vary. It would appear in exact increment proportion to my deviation from the adherence to that mental state. 

> [!WARNING]
> ### Christmas, 2018 pre-trauma
> 
> It was at night, near 2 AM, 3 AM, or 4 AM when that peace turned to horror. I had to pull some energy — not from my sacrum, but from whatever system was moving "down." There was a spider, a small spider, that seemed friendly at first, not as though it was going to change my energy state. As it moved its fingers from its stance on the leaf or branch or ground, I felt the energy/pressure of my third eye tangling up with its movements, horrifying. I felt "third eye" energy/pressure for maybe the past month, a physical, literal pressure, that I had influence over the movement of (which I haven't had since the kundalini disruption from the hospital), that with the spider, I felt pushing forward and moving, behind my eyes and above the bridge of my nose. And somehow I was told the attenuation to what I need to do depended on my wisdom teeth  clenched from my jaws, as tight as possible, while with my not-sacrum open. 3 of my wisdom teeth had been removed, but one kept my jaw in some locked-unlocked position that seemed to open my throat. Clenched teeth and emptily evacuated anal cavity, respectively, as long as possible. I had one orange slice that I brought with me. I think I tried to give a piece to the spider. I believed I had to evacuate it, that the spider was crawling up my intensines, to retrieve the last energy that had needed evacuation, and the spider had failed. In retrospect, maybe the purpose was to evacuate all energy from my system so as not to hurt others. I recall being told, while still day, in my inner understanding-stream, that it was "for the sake of the children," that all adults knew this information, but it was needed to be kept secret for the sake of the children. I think I even malleted a stick against a tree and heard the rhythm reciprocated, from some opposite side of the woods, across the brook, somebody else who "knew" this information (if anybody was there at all, it was probably a child). And then, as the night deepened, after trying to sleep, laying there, hearing the geese singing (yes, a loud goose in particular, with different calls from the different birds, sometimes sounding like laughter as though I was being mocked), imagining a giant goose, flying up, and then leaving the cold night to silence, and when the bird and birds flew away the night was silent, freezing, my energy was anxious, I couldn't sleep, and my thoughts "came to," except with less clarity and peace than before in the psychotic/adherent state. I believed that my mom had come to find me and was drowning. I scrambled through the woods, pushing branches out of the way, getting cut through my arms as I ran to where I thought, or maybe heard, my mom was drowning, in the darkness, in the sewage water waste where the sewage pipe maybe poured into from the nearby Wegmans and more suburban apartment region. I jumped in, and flailed my arms around, going underwater trying to find my mom.

My mom actually had been nearby, I later learned. By some intuition, she went near those woods, to search for me earlier in the day. I left for a long time, I'd seemed paranoid, seemed to be checking if she was alive or not in the middle of an earlier night by waking her to check, had been doing yoga a lot, she took out the trash and I still wasn't anywhere nearby and my car was parked there, and it was a cold day, a cold winter day, freezing day, and my mom was waiting and by 2 PM thought, "No, something's wrong. It's not possible he's wandering this long." So she thought I was walking near the pond near Wegmans, that maybe I fell in there, and she walked through the snow to look for me in that woods area, she searched and was looking for tracks, she thought maybe she even found tracks, and she followed them through snow, near houses, all the way to a road, a different road than the one I'd reached, and she was cold, my mom realized something was wrong, went home, called the police that her son was missing, but they didn't know where.

The I Ching had called those disruptions, the guidances that were navigating me, "Grace." And in Taoist philosophy, "Grace" isn’t necessarily good. Those winds, as they push us, are, to put it in Richard Wilhelm’s words, "beauty in form," and in the I Ching’s taxonomy, such a state to a person’s psyche and cosmology "has success in small matters […] but he dare not decide controversial issues in this way."

Perhaps this is what I was supposed to learn from the betrayal in my mind’s newly activated much-deeper-more-acute-intense intuitions. However, I suspect maybe something else as the mechanism, something in the collective consciousness, something that brought "grace," as my work actualized into a paper and my social life dwindled and my body came to look ever more like Gollum’s — or that like my meditation’s mantra, Aing (though originally from Sanskrit), the character Aang from Avatar the last Airbender, a bald idealistic kid — from extreme intelligence to extreme stupidity. 

In my second hospitalization, that followed the RGH one that followed all of this, the environment was much better than future hospitalizations. I made friends with Sarah and Hudson and others. We played Guitar Hero together, there was a piano, there were TVs, some of the public rooms had big windows, we even were taken across floors of the hospital for music jamming sessions with lots of instruments, they had their yoga and meditation instructions as well, and of all of my hospitalizations to come, this was by far the best care unit I was gated by armored vault into. 

Sarah’s sister’s name is "Kundalini Grace." I hadn’t heard of "Kundalini" until after I had those visceral, physical sensations in the House on May St. Then I looked up those sensations I was experiencing and found, for the first time, not having heard the word or of those movements and sensations before, the term "Kundalini," made more credible to me by the philosophy’s appreciation by the depth psychologist Carl Jung, who I was reading at the time, and whose views, very distinct from Freud's, on the existence of a subconscious, and its mystical-transcendent connection, helped explain some of what I was witnessing. 

Sarah Young’s last name is pronounced "Jung" and here’s quite a synchronicity: she and I kept observing synchronicities while we were there, and she hadn't heard of Jung. She even kept a synchronicity list. To me, no synchronicities happened yet that were bigger than just the uncanny precision and specificity of the I Ching’s answers. However, I was still seeing some unambiguous synchronicities, as well as not seeing many others, including that the word "synchronicity" was actually coined by Jung, and now I was remarking on them  together with one Sarah "Jung." But there were more I hadn't seen, and more, much bigger, that would come.

The House on May St., in retrospect was one big synchronicity. I got the Facebook student housing page moderatorship just before I had to move out, and was able to deliver on my promise to fill my landlord’s house (and houses) with grad students. Not to mention, the house itself. Having that whole house, pretty much to myself, a beautiful antique house, for relatively pennies, the same house I had my AI and physics revelations — "luck" seems to forget a lot of context.

So the word "synchronicity" was already familiar, as was Jung, as was Kundalini, as was Grace, by the time Sarah and I met in the hospital. 

We played Guitar Hero, I continued all of my meditation and yoga regimen, and my family, including my mom, uncle and aunt, and cousin brought in Paleo diet food for me, which I ate for my eczema but which also helped with my cognition, instead of the unhealthy processed type food of the hospital. And I shared crapes with Sarah, that my aunt brought in each time she and my uncle visited. They weren't 100% Paleo (buckwheat, goat cheese), but still delicious.

> A couple weeks after returning from Finland in summer, 2017, after meeting Jane there, a short Jewish stoner-y anime-character person I met, I met another short Jewish stoner-y anime-character, Emilie, who paralleled Jane in every horrible specific way I probably shouldn't write. That was one of the few people I ever interacted with. In the hospital, I met another Jane-representative-type person, distinct from Jane, very much a person too, but still with some characteristic Jane. Jane preceded the Dupilumab. Emilie about coincided, maybe a week after my first injection.
>
> Sarah was 24, a year older than me, worked at a convenience store, like Jane, and had gotten hospitalized for getting drunk and trashing the whole convenience store in a somewhat psychotic fit, something Jane unfortunately doesn’t do. Her personality, pertaining to addiction and being kind of crude/cold, coincided.

My brother-in-law came in with my sister and I explained to him relational reasoning and the paper I submitted, the method of MHDPA. I explained to him the method underlying ChatGPT from my hospital ward 5 years before ChatGPT. And at the time, he thought my explanation was cool, but it’d’ve been hard to predict would be such a big thing, one that others in my field and the world would have anywhere to as much belief in the utility in AI of, in the near-term, ever, or 5 years from then. It was hard to predict for my professors and faculty, too. At the time, 2018/early-2019, most at the University of Rochester still thought deep learning was a fad. None of the professors or other PhD students were doing research on MHDPA, let alone had heard of MHDPA. [They might claim otherwise, but the professors had a knack for not giving credit when ego was at risk, and both the professors and the students were often really dumb](#4-Faith.md), like in the academic sense, if after all this, my "general" intelligence is doubted. Besides the paper that proposed MHDPA itself, my innovation to MHDPA, was the first innovation to MHDPA ever, in the world. A small handful of others applied it, from research groups in DeepMind, none literally innovated the method.

I showed my MHDPA innovation paper to Sarah. She was amazed that she could read it since usually, she said, that kind of stuff isn't readable, and brought up one more synchronicity. Her mom was a writer who had a published short story in a Stephen King anthology, a writer of horror. I was indeed in a hospitalization that was like a pretty good short story in an otherwise Stephen King anthology. 

Not that my lucidity needed evidence, but I explained the methods of late-2022 ChatGPT to inpatient and visitors, in early-February, Winter, 2019, while drugs were altering and innovating on the functioning of *my* biological neural networks.

#### Hudson

Our other companion was Hudson, who caught me as I was being discharged and handed me this letter in an envelope, that I opened later from my apartment:

<p align="center">
<img width="300" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-12 at 8 10 34 PM" src="https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/assets/9126603/d5414cba-2012-42f9-b516-f06dd8760cad">
</p>

I'm impressed he was able to write at all. He had depression, was in the hospital for depression, was being treated for depression, was medicated for depression, and was electroshocked weekly, lightning bolts of happiness, for depression. I guess if the core of a patient’s depression isn’t "lack of pills," the evidence-backed next step is to get some jumper cables to their ears.

Meanwhile, now checking my phone to make sure we are indeed in the 21st century, I was being chemically waterboarded and brain damaged via benzos, but who could’ve known that? Oh wait, I did, because I made the case articulately to my psychiatrists. As I predicted, long-term benzo use is dangerous, causes extreme physical dependence, and can result in unthinkable suffering. 

I was told a court order would be acquired if I didn't take them, even as I was taking antipsychotics.

> ### Short-term benzo administration is a matter that requires more nuance
>
> My mom stopped them from electroshocking me, but I have no evidence to this or record, besides our memories and those strangers we don't remember who were involved. I was staring up at the two lights from my blurred eyes, that were really just one light from the light fixture, when the nurses injected me with benzos due to my having gone motionless, thinking that if I said anything, somehow that would risk my relationship with Jane, so I lay still, somewhat like I was paralyzed, but with my eyes open and following those light glares. They said they were going to take me to electroshock therapy, they were about to roll me off for electroshock therapy, the benzos kicked in, I was no longer feeling that conviction about the need to stay still, and then for some reason the nurses paused, and they were talking to my mom and my mom started saying something really irritating, that, for some reason, due to the benzo disinhibition I irritatedly reacted to, and then my mom responded, and I responded again, now feeling like I ruined whatever committed state I was in, and the nurses were exasperated and said something like, "Okay good, we were gonna take you to electroshock therapy."

### My trauma

> [!NOTE]
> ### Israel birthright trip, and Jeremiah
>
> #### Mistaken airplane seat, and church bells ringing in the air
>
> The first thing Jeremiah told me on the plane to Israel was about his Schizophrenia. He was seated next to me, for our birthright trip. At the time, he went to Cornell. He was seated next to me just by chance, after one other person, mistakenly, had taken Jeremiah's seat, thinking it as his seat, a Columbia law student who later appreciated my idea of democratizing the Board of Directors of companies to facillitate a more democratic structure to the systems that all of us are subservient to, which at the time, 2016 ([though not 2020](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=bernie+democracy+in+teh+workplace&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&dlnr=1&sei=xuPYZp_9G-Gi5NoPo5TV4A8)), was, to my knowledge (almost definitely not actually), my original idea. He skeptically called it "internally consistent."
>
> On the bus driving through some city in Israel, maybe Tel Aviv or Jerusalem, I was telling Jeremiah about my Israel-critical political views and I think atheism, and he was telling me his were less critical and he believed in God. It turned out, he went to the same high school as my friend, Zach Palumbo, who argued with him about religion. Zach Palumbo, like me, was atheist. Small synchronicity: but I had a friend named Josiah, who I argued with about politics and religion all through high school, since we met in Mrs. "Bellaire" (like "Bell Air")'s World History class. Not an airplane (or city in Los Angeles, nor a church bell in the air), a teacher.
>
> #### Zach Palumbo's Josiah
>
> Josiah was Christian and had, to be honest, much weaker views than Jeremiah, especially as Jeremiah was a Bernie Sanders supporter, whereas Josiah was a hardcore conservative Republican Christian fundamentalist.
>
> Zach's "Josiah" was a weaker, meaning much less irritating, opponent. Come 12th grade, I met Zach Palumbo, the first person I ever thought was intelligent, but unlike me, he went to a private school where he and all of his views were extremely popular. Someone who went there, who I met through Josiah, and then re-met through Jeremiah, evoking this difference between our schools well, felt edgy for *not* liking John Green and for *liking* One Direction. Zach professionally acts in theater, he sings and plays lots of instruments, he also majored in Computer Science like me and was trying to triple major in the same three fields in a similarly-ranked university, like me, though grew up in a wealthy house with two parents. He and I shared so many of the same interests. He was the first person I ever met who liked Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which I want to say, "is the metric by which I gauged intelligence," and that's probably true, but all of those political and religious and philosophical and academic factors were pretty informative, too, and in a way that I never saw before, someone with so much emotional and social intelligence *wanting*, enthusiastically, to hang out with me. He even somewhat helped develop my alternative/experimental/indie music knowledge/taste. I related so much to him, about our interests, in particular TV, film, YouTube, book (not sure if that can be made plural), blog(s) (namely, Harris O'Malley's and [Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along](https://youtu.be/Of9kHpCv1ts?si=QRV4mfdjs9C3uSO0)), and more. Our political views, back in 2013, were not standard among our generation and adopted by most everybody in our generation, at the time, despite the bandwagon that has arisen, for the better in my opinion, since 2016. There wasn't as much of a reductive term for them, maybe "liberal" or "progressive." And we both debated, passionately in our respective high schools, for those views, as Obama was being elected, and I supported not-yet-at-voting-age with a non-partisan school Election Day video I'd made that included a debate I'd participated in, and impassioned efforts to convince people, including friends, including Josiah, and new people I hadn't met before, as well. Those views, much like John Green (and not necessarily post-Wall-Street-bailout Obama), no matter the relative perspective or context, are cool. [Don't forget to be awesome.](https://store.dftba.com/?srsltid=AfmBOop4yQKFFcVx6E9ub3WsF5kr6kDw8CZTPH45Pb9o3emtTgKKmNHr) His friend (Zach's, not John Green, also not the person who didn't like John Green), let's call her Sair-AH, later remarked to me, "You're just like Zach. You're literally the same person." And that was the truly, most flattering thing anyone's ever said to me — I've been envious of Zach all my life (since I met him, in 12th grade), since I saw how well he expressed all of the views and many tastes that we shared, and how well so many people appreciated his expression, something that my social anxiety at the time and lack of many social understandings (read: inexperience), really kept me from doing. So apparently Jeremiah, was Zach's Josiah. They argued about religion and politics. Jeremiah, however, was not my Josiah. Jeremiah, was another pivotal player, who's been my best friend for less time than Josiah, but has endured trauma that is similar to some of the more extreme kind, I more recently endured. All three of us were outcasts. That person I met through Josiah during my benzo trauma, and then re-met by chance through Jeremiah (who didn't like John Green), somehow was one of few people during that time period (upcoming, not yet described, not even during this Part, let alone chapter) who treated me like enough of an equal to give me serious time together with her in public, on normal, magically infused dates initially matched not when Josiah introduced me, not when Jeremiah introduced me, but really against all odds, by me running into her, over and over again, *shortly after Jeremiah re-introduced us*, just by magical luck, just by really-improbable chance, at the beach I'd been regularly going to that summer, maybe a week after Jeremiah's birthday party where she kept mis-calling Jeremiah, "Josiah."
>
> Like the Columbia law student who sat in Jeremiah's seat, and the anti-John-Green-ist, something that resonates about Jeremiah to me is the sense that, something, it's hard to say what, sometimes sort of steals, or rather mistakes, his identity.
>
> #### Lizzie
>
> I remember when I was with Lizzie, let's give her a name, at Jeremiah's birthday party, I found, despite having no social anxiety, I couldn't be myself. She even liked me, told me something personal about herself, but there was a gravitation in my consciousness, or a "swirl" that was bringing me out of my clear-est mindset. She started chatting more with another guy there, and I was feeling dejected, then we were at the dinner table, and all talking, Lizzie was getting all of the good attention, and that other guy; Jeremiah was being partially ignored. Then Jeremiah said something to the group about some really specific interesting fact he'd read, like maybe about aliens. And I replied. And he continued. And I replied, and felt like a pressure, like a physical sense that his strength was almost pressing in, but I replied. And it was with this phonetic strength that I had, natural, that might've shut Jeremiah down from further inquiry, on this topic that was really idiosyncratic, but he replied again, completely innocently but with his strength (one could say) defeating my earlier phonetics, and sensing, those phonetics, but also hearing what he said, I replied again, respectfully and extremely specifically to what Jeremiah had said. And the guy next to me, that guy, choked on his food, and I sensed a sudden change in the whole dimensions of that dinner table, everybody sitting there, Jeremiah's family, Lizzie. And I could tell the guy, to my left, was paying me respect, and my state of consciousness completely without swirl, sharp and blissful, suddenly. Jeremiah's family members were asking me questions, now really interested on a totally different topic, that Jeremiah also added respectfully to, telling his parents about how my family immigrated from Uzbekistan, in part due to my Uncle Sasha, that I was a first-generation immigrant, too. And Lizzie's I could tell, as her linguistics tripped over themselves and stopped being as coherent, had gotten that "swirl" consciousness. I was confident, talking to Lizzie, who was confused now about how I could be first-generation, talking to the guy, still talking to Jeremiah, still answering his family's questions, and Lizzie ran out of the room. Spontaneously, without any warning, she left, and one questioned why or asked what had happened. SOmehow it was just commonplace to them, but that guy had choked on his food just when the consciousness/dimensions shift happened, and all of my cognition and sharpness changed rapidly, like I'd never seen it happen, and Lizzie's became less in her control, more incoherent, and then she ran out.
>
> There is a power in the collective sphere. I don't know what it is. It's not vampyrism, but there is something, and the subsequent run-ins and dates with Lizzie, at the beach, where she invited me to her house for tea, introduced me to her family, and, after all of my adhering to the state of consicousness that I sensed, which didn't allow me to so much as hold her hand (except it told me to once on one of the last says I saw her and I missed that window, and despite her literally giving me a hug once on command, again, feuled by just adhering to those linguistics and phonetics I sensed), even asked me, in cryptic multi-meanings, "Do you ever want ice cream?" which I answered, "All the time" and I understood and she understood, though crypticism isn't intelligent. And the thing is, after Josiah had introduced me to her, from seeing her Facebook, I thought she was kind of dumb. But, (a) she wasn't, and (b) she understood things that Zach Palumbo (maybe) wouldn't have. About John Green, I said "depends," about her perspective, and she understood what I meant, regarding the reverse. Then later, on one of our last dates, she asked (something like, paraphrasing), "Is this just research?" I didn't answer, and no, it wasn't, and by "it" I mean every part of me that can be attributed to me, as my conscious — those dates meant so much to me — but by that same adherence is what brought me to the beach to run into her and was guiding my interactions, phonetics, and linguistics, I didn't answer. The answer was a big no. I was terrified, from start to no-ice-cream finish. Literally whatever these forces were, that non-locally connected me to her multiple times on the beach, which I remarked on and which she just treated as commonplace, those synchronciities, oculd've literally been some cosmic power with a long-term plan for the good of humankind that depended on my exact adherence, for all i knew, and I had to wait and see, to see what the heck those synchronciities and my senses, this time, now highly rewarding and visceral and logical, were leading to.
>
> She could've potentially been wrong about all three things. First, crypticism ("ice cream") isn't the ideal way to just ask about things, but in that context, it felt good. Then "depends" about John Green, well, that's subjective. I could, hypothetically, stop being leftist just because everyone in my generation is Woke. But I don't, because my opinions, on both art and politics, are based on actual principles, and not counter-culture. And the third thing, she was really wrong about.

My cousin Irina, who went with me, and I, got the most sick, of the whole bus, even though whatever it was originated with someone else on the trip.

I recovered, also from really severe fever, sneezing, sinuses, and coughing, without hospital or drugs, but less so due to any sort of moral conviction and more so just laziness about visiting the doctor. Our whole bus was so sick. People were vomiting, and somehow still having sex.

> About two years after my first Strong Hospital hospitalization, Jeremiah, in February, 2021, who I hadn't seen since the trip to Israel, commented on a Facebook post that I'd made about the trauma that benzos induced on me, about some of his experiences. He wrote publicly on my post about how some psychiatric medication he had to take caused him to have a seizure. "[...] I've had bad side effects from medications that caused me to have a seizure one time that was no fun. [...]" Benzos [cause seizures during the brain's GABA downregulation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21815323/#:~:text=Withdrawal%20seizures%20have%20occurred%20with,time%20and%20at%20high%20doses.), something I've seen reported anecdotally in pharmaceutical recovery forums, extremely often. Social media reports aren't given credibility by many psychiatrists, though they should be. And in spite of standard-*seeming* consensuses, seizures are a pretty standard side effect, and the calculus of whether they're worth inducing for the sake of the tequila-like effect of benzos makes me question whether literally just prescribing margaritas, a tequila cocktail drink, would achieve all the same effects, and even safer (give or take some vomitting and faster-less-insidiously-presenting-themselves repercussions), especially with pepperoni. How would doctors administer a "shot" of pizza into a patient? Maybe they could use a shot glass, with anchovies, and no seizures, and maybe some rum.

Psychiatrists would be unlikely to have the bravery to do a proper control study on whether tequila might actually just be better for many use cases than benzos. ["The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword,"](https://youtu.be/_lSjlt59yjw?si=1sboUg9FBLXlMm1Q) and most psychiatrists have enough experience and familiarity with alcohol to have the wisdom not to prescribe it beyond the basic use cases where it might enrich a person’s life more than hurt it. The characterization difference between alcohol and benzos is not proportional to their actual health-endangerment difference. Either one needs to be characterized better, or the other needs to be characterized worse.

#### Clicking their healing pens three times

My trauma revolves around three psychiatrists.

The first psychiatrist wasn't bad, a young guy who understood my hesitation about taking benzos, knew I was arguing against using them to the nurses and to him, and reassured me I'd be off them before discharge. We walked together in the hall and he sensed that I was bright. The social lubricant of benzos gave me "flying colors" that I think he sensed were authoritative, about my knowledge of benzos and intelligence. He said I'd be weaned off before the discharge, and that was the schedule. I felt pretty at ease. I was under the impression for a while I would be weaned off from the drugs before discharge. He reassured, I would be weaned off *before* discharge.

The second psychiatrist, an Asian woman, looked stern and astute, came in on the momentum of her previous post, and without much thought just changed the schedule. She was standing next to the first psychiatrist, who hesitantly, self-doubtingly told her that he'd planned to taper me off before the discharge since I was worried, but she was dismissive, about the original plan and our preferances. She said the tapering schedule was too fast and the outpatient doctor, the psychiatrist after the hospitalization, would wean me off. Maybe she didn't trust that I would continue with therapy if the physiological addiction didn't send me there by threat, but this time, she gave the reassurance, that I'd be tapered *right after* discharge.

They didn't question if the diagnoses, in particular "catatonia," were actually what I went through. I didn't know the specific definition of catatonia, which is what the benzos were meant to treat, but adherence to yogic-type senses, delusional or not, safe to intervene on with drugs or not, isn't the same as catatonia. The other diagnosis from the medical record was "bipolar mania," for which I was being given Risperdals, a strong antipsychotic, in addition to benzos.

I wasn't asked what happened to me. It was as if "catatonia" and "bipolar mania" were the only description needed, indubitably exhaustive. Were I asked, I'm not sure I'd have been able to explain it to them, necessarily. The Christmas, 2018 trauma took the last 5 years for me to process into a form that I could write, let alone speak, let alone boil down into a spoonful under pressure, and the pressure was higher with each subsequent psychaitrist because my "flying colors" were increasingly faded.

None of the previous diagnoses from the first hospitalization, none of what RGH wrote, were investiagted or asked about in any extent by the University of Rochester’s psychiatrists, nor were either of them precisely true (at least "catatonia"). None of the events were inquired about.

The euphoria was turning into grey cloud and fog. I was in cognitive decline by the second psychiatrist. Then, after I was discharged, more cognitive decline and anxiety, excruciating anxiety and physical agony.

The third psychiatrist, the outpatient doctor, also University of Rochester, was worse in every way. 

In the first month with him, I told him my symptoms. He was cold, authoritative, and disbelieving. He didn't believe me or show even the slightest emotion of warmth. If he cared about me in the slightest, he did everything possible to show otherwise. He only believed the benzos were needed. He left no room for argument. He argued down my arguments, with the conviction of an authority with no humility whatsoever, that they could be safely taken for years.

At no point did he specify a tapering schedule, and I was begging him.

I was experiencing cognitive impairment, like cognition not just grey but Requiem For A Dream-grey, anxiety constant. But from his  disbelieving clinical authority, all of my symptoms were, wrongly, dismissed as characteristic of some disorder I had. 3 months into the benzos, my memory, speech, and imagination were gone. In that month, I told him I thought I was brain damaged, and that I was in physical pain, that I had tinnitus, and that I'd read from multiple scientific studies that brain damage from benzos may be permanent. He wanted to increase the dose. I begged him to taper, and he thought if I was having all those negative symptoms, that the dose must've been too low. He wanted to increase the dose, as if that would reduce my brain's increasing system-wide downregulation of GABA, rather than worsen its effort to fight the dysregulation.

In case you're wondering, he was an idiot. I should've weaned myself off, without his support, but I didn't have the conviction due to the impairment induced by the drug to go against his recommendation and instruction — and I write this with the same truth value as "the Holocaust was bad": I should've weaned myself off then, or better yet, immediately, as soon as I could've started weaning. The brain damage, and literally — when memory, speech, and imagination are all impaired, and the patient's in pain, *the brain is damaged* — risked being permanent and irreversible, according to studies I found and the fact that nobody understands neurodegeneration.

I was in severe pain and agony by the next month with that doctor. He responded with only authority, no reasoning, and no sensitivity. He made no consideration to the possibility that I was right or he was wrong. I wasn't able to recall sentimental memories or easily do basic math, grey cognition, non-stop anxiety, non-stop torture. As these months progressed, my facial structure changed, wrinkled and lost youth. What I suffered was physiologically brain damage. My cognition and perception deteriorated severely, and tinnitus, mouth dryness, and wrinkles added to the mounting evidence of damages happening not just to my psyche, but to my brain and body. With benzos, that damage can be permanent. 

The brain's writing mechanisms revolve around memory. During that period, I had no memory. My linguistics have nothing vivid to center on because everything from that period was grey. From the first psychiatrist, it was flyingly colorful, but a blur, like the most effective binge-drinking session that had no end, until it did. With the second psychiatrist, the memory is fuzzy, for both the daze of that hangover, and the increasing anxiety of my brain's dysregulated GABA. The third psychiatrist, is like Schindler's List-grey, like not even a little girl carrying an umbrella. I saw him for about 5 months and don't remember his name, which is too bad, or I would write it here in capital letters.

1. That psychiatrist wanted to increase the dose, not realizing that that would start a perpetual race against the brain's downregulation mechanisms. After I told him my symptoms, and doubts, his clinical authority meant more to him than my agony.
2. The benzo drug market is a $3 billion industry. [Suspiciously, there are contradictions in recent studies from previous decades, on the same drugs. "the Medical Research Council (MRC) in Britain agreed in 1982 that there should be large-scale studies to examine the long-term impact of benzodiazepines after research by a leading psychiatrist showed brain shrinkage in some patients similar to the effects of long-term alcohol abuse." The study was buried: "The only problem with the MRC's response to such warnings about benzos? It appears to have sat for thirty years on the very documents that warned about the risks of brain shrinkage in patients taking them. Moreover, the MRC appears to have marked the documents 'closed until 2014,' despite their obvious importance to public health. [...] 'Members of Parliament and lawyers,' she continues, 'described the recently revealed documents as a scandal, and predicted they could lead the way to a class action costing millions.'"](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/side-effects/201011/pharmaceutical-scandal-in-britain-sheds-disturbing-new-light)
3. What could've caused three psychiatrists, with zero scheduling consensus between each other, and zero consent from the patient, to cause so much damage? I suspect the >6 months of inconsistent psychiatrist and doctor plans were due to the self-reinforcing biases clinicians (in the general sense) can create in themselves as they change a patient's personality through chemical interventions. My personality started very charming and cheerful due to the benzos, at which point they still planned to wean me off within the hospital. Then fear and anxiety rose due to increasing downregulation. As those induced neurological changes "doctored" my perception and psyche, my believability lessened (due solely to reduced neurological function, not any fundamental behavioral change aside from mental impairment, and no catatonia, or mania, or delusion), and each changing shift of psychiatrists extended the asserted duration of the coerced prescription of the previous, changing the plans of the previous psychiatrists, culminating with the outpatient doctor only willing to increase, with no taper schedule on the planned horizon. Doctors are aggressively playing Gods, and have no understanding of the severe bias that their own interventions produce in their own or each other's clinical decision-making. Measurement-bias is a known problem in science. Detection can result in a change in the state of the physical system (or organism or body) being detected. In medicine, this problem is less widely understood since the subjects being observed, detected, analyzed, judged, and changed are people.
4. Even financial systemic biases notwithstanding, the third psychiatrist's overt disbelief towards my suffering, and involuntary perpetuation of my consumption of those drugs on the basis of my insecurity about weaning off by myself, is inexcusable.
5. This reminds me, that outpatient doctor commented on my bald head. He wouldn't believe me that the hair loss was induced. $\color{#d08370}\text{He}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{interrogated,}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{rather}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{repeatedly,}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{even}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{after}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{I}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{answered,}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{whether}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{I}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{had}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{pulled}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{the}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{hair}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{out}$ $\color{#d08370}\text{myself}$.

The brain's GABA being downregulated is like living in an active war zone. Coercively induced, it is, without exaggeration, a legalized form of torture, neurochemical waterboarding, except the effect persists beyond each cranium drowning, without a moment's break for air. Former addicts of heroin or cocaine who were on benzos have reported, in anecdotes I've seen in pharmaceutical recovery forums, that those side effects and withdrawals of benzo-induced GABA downregulation were worse than the side effects and withdrawals they'd suffered from heroin or cocaine. Not long ago, lobotomies and conversion therapies were standard psychiatric practice. Coercion in psychiatric medicine, especially long-term, especially of benzos will be recognized by history as barbarism.

#### International date, couch, suicide attempt, and literally-self-bootstrapped recovery

At after the 6 month point, I gradually reduced the dose, now entering the "hungover" chemical waterboarding phase, characteried mainly by a couch, but not a therapy couch, finally away from the therapists, at home, in my mom's and I apartment.

Starting some months (maybe 4th month) into taking the benzos, before I began weaning, I was laying on the couch, immobilized, shaking with excruciating agony. No sleep, no escape. No exit, just PhD work (yes, and not easily) and torture. Skin dry, teeth calcifying (at a dental cleaning appointment, the hygienist diagnosed it as calcification and the attributed cause as dry mouth due to benzodiazepines), no memory, no linguistic expression, cognition completely grey and burning. All color gone, all imagery, all imagination, only pain, perpetual pain and fear. Terror. Terror terror terror. I remember one day trying to do $4*7$, and not being able to. They say the only thing to fear is fear itself: GABA downregulation is fear itself. The experience is like being in a warzone. It's like burning alive — without stop — more than a year, torture. The neurochemical experience is literally what you go through if you're in a warzone, and being chased by a predator, while in the middle of having a seizure: hellfire, indescribable pain. I remember staying up nights shaking, trying CBD oil or L-theanine (latter didn't work — the CBD oil, which I got from that herbal apothecary near the house on May St., when I stopped in because I didn't know that building had become a herbal apothecary, helped a little, and after I talked with the store workers about the different chemicals they had, the woman at the counter asked to add me as a friend on Facebook, which was serendipitous and miraculous for me, but then stopped replying as soon as I messaged suggesting they host meditations in the park next door because my wording, due to literal brain damage, was probably awkward) to try to sleep and just shaking, electricity swarming through me, my face curled, deformed as I tensed and agonized all night unless I got some sleep if I was lucky and then waking up feeling like that, again, for the rest of the day, every day, for months like this. These symptoms started around maybe the 4 month mark while I was still on the benzos and persisted for more than a year. "This is a very common thing" ([even at lower doses](https://youtu.be/laheAXdZK7w?si=FuPXGh1cLuuvtfHW)). I've read former cocaine and heroin addicts say long-term benzo neurotoxicity involves more horrific suffering than withdrawal from cocaine or heroin. I'm sure there isn't an experience on this Earth that is worse, humanly or cosmically possible (a year without sleep, non-stop neurochemical fire, not sure that's even imaginable). 

The nightmare I mentioned earlier was a waking one for a year.

You know, the way I learned about the calcification was because chunks of what I thought were tooth were falling out. Just chunks of tooth-like pieces from my mouth. So I went to the dental hygienist and she said it was de-calcification. This was already when I was starting to recover to some extent, when I was already on the steak-only diet. To reiterate: it started *de*-calcifying at that point. The calcification built up a lot during the 6 months I was on benzos. That was her diagnosis: calcification due to dry mouth from benzos.

The steak-diet saved my ass.

TO DO: Mention I tried to kill myself, seriously, how my family took the helium tank away

Mention that I had to buy waist straps to get myself off of the couch

The trauma I went through during my psychosis (which the psychiatrists didn't even know about) doesn't compare to the year of benzo neurochemical torture.

The experience of losing my hair has cost me relationships and worsened my social anxiety, and the benzo-brain damage and torture leaves me with PTSD.

Many Jews, were executed or tortured, or piled in bodies, when the Nazis occupied Ukraine. Ukraine was already sympathetic with Nazi anti-semitism before the occupation, but now Jews in droves fled to Russia, or Muslim nations to the East, a couple days train ride away, like Kazakhstan or Uzbekistan, for refuge. My grandpa's father, Yakob, couldn’t evacuate because he was drafted to fight in the warfront. My grandpa’s mom Mañá, my grandpa’s younger sister Rosá, and my grandpa, Yury, who was about 13, fled to Kazakhstan together. At the end of the war, they returned to Chernihiv, Ukraine and reunited with Yakob. My grandpa went to a college in Kiev; my grandma, Asya, who my grandpa had met before in childhood actually, went to a different college in Kiev. They met again and married. Then the Soviet Union assigned my grandpa to a job in a sheepskin manufacturing plant/factory in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, where my grandpa had to work as a leather technology engineer. My grandma emigrated with him and found a job there as well, teaching German. So my grandparents emigrated from Kiev, Zhytomyr, or Chernihiv to Samarkand, in 1952.

My uncle Slava was the first one born, then my mom Nélya, both in Samarkand. Then, via my aunt Jenya, my older cousins Lena and Irina, and finally my older sister Marina, and I, all of us also in Samarkand, all of us also Ashkenazi Jews. My name, "Sam of Samarkand," happened entirely by chance, and in America. I was "Siímyon," after my grandma’s sister’s (Tslia’s) late husband Siímyon. He died several years before I was born. That’s the full name. "Syoma" is what I go by with my family. 

I had severe eczema from a month and a half "age" old. I got this itchiness, and scratched myself, scratched myself to blood. I itched the whole body, cried, scratched myself, scratched, cried. My mom had to put cloths on my hands, baby’s cloths to cover my hands, so I don’t scratch to blood. 

When I was 2, about 3, a family friend, Shafkad, said there is some man in some village, some far away village, who can treat people, a healer, a shaman, not a traditional healer, and he said he can take us there to see what this person can say or do; maybe he can heal me from eczema. He drove us there. A man (different man, not the healer) came, somebody Shafkad knew, and this man said, "I’ll take him to that healer, no you stay here," my mom wanted to go; "no you not allowed"; they didn’t let her go there, maybe because she was a woman and it was Muslim. She was worried; Shafkad assured that everything is alright either way. He knows these people. "No no, they good people, they heal." 

They were waiting and after some time, maybe 20 minutes, they brought me back, two people, the guy who took me and another, the shaman, healer, a short man, Uzbek or Tajik maybe, native Uzbek looking, middle age, maybe 40 something, 50. He said he couldn’t heal me, that he got rid of all demons from me and couldn’t heal it.  "Sorry, I couldn’t, I don’t know how to, I couldn’t help your son, I don’t know how to fix it." And he said, "Are you going to America? Maybe they can heal him. They have better doctors there." 

He didn’t take money. He just said, "I couldn’t heal him. I can’t." 

The shaman somehow knew that we were immigrating, maybe Shafkad told him, somehow he knew, mom didn’t know how.

My grandma's sister, "Tsotya" Tsilia, and her son, my uncle Sasha, were the first to immigrate to America. My grandma, uncle, and mom applied for refugee status to immigrate as well. My grandparents and uncle’s family were approved, whereas my mom, sister, and I, weren’t. So my grandparents immigrated, and sent an invitation to my mom through the embassy. My mom had to fly with us to Moscow, in January, to do an interview at the American Embassy in Moscow to convince them that she was subjugated. 

"Your form said you have kids. Where are they?"

She had spent the whole day at the embassy, from early morning to night. She said, "I left them with relatives. I cannot bring them here. They would be suffering here. My youngest is 3. It would be torture for them here, without food, without sleep."

Jenya’s brother’s family lived in Moscow, so my mom was able to leave us with them while she went to the embassy to petition for refugee status.

"A lot of people bring their children here. They think that showing children to us will gain them sympathy, and pity."

"I thought I didn’t have to bring them, the documentation said we didn’t."

"Yes yes, you’re right," the interviewer said. "Why, to America, you're going?"

"I’m going to meet with my family, mom, dad, my brother is already there. I’m the only one left, with my children. My cousin, my brother, everyone is already there. And, second, because there is anti-semitism in Uzbekistan."

"What, in Uzbekistan, you suffered persecution?"

Anti-semitism in Uzbekistan wasn’t as bad as in other countries, she told me. In Ukraine, anti-semitism was always worse, from the war when my grandpa was young, to when my mom was an adult. However, she told me, Jews customarily weren’t allowed to hold higher offices in Uzbekistan.

"I was at the conservatory, I wanted to study in a PhD program, I couldn’t. First, when I was a student, I wanted to continue my studies as a PhD student, but there wasn’t a chance for me, because I was Jewish."

She wanted to do a doctoral, but wasn’t allowed to, despite having graduated with a diploma with distinction for both college and in the conservatory of music where she earned her master's degree in Music Theory. Her thesis was recommended as the best reseach paper for publishing, recommended by a committee member who came from Russia to listen to the presentations, and she submitted it, but it was never published, because "Lerman" is a Jewish name, not Uzbek name.

She continued, "Jewish people don’t openly keep their traditions there, they don’t get good jobs/positions. I was professor teaching at music college. I had to stop working there last year [in 1998], because they reduced my hours, and not just me, but other Jewish people. Uzbeks they gave many." My uncle found her a temporary job for an American firm, that had originally been offered to him, where she did indexing, tabulating, and auditing, nothing to do with music theory, despite having been a professor at the music college, respected and loved by her students.

To get refugee status, she had to argue to the interviewer that she deserved refugee status from Uzbekistan, a Muslim country, a Jewish woman with a master's degree whose parents and brother already immigrated from Uzbekistan and were already approved by the same consulate for refugee status.

The interview ended.

We flew to Rochester, New York, immigrating officially as Jewish refugees, half a year since the embassy interview. I was 3 and two thirds, and had cried, perhaps foretellingly, on the plane. My name, was legally mistranslated to "Semen." My mom (whose name was translated "Nellya") found a low-paying piano teaching job, and hoped to earn more money, so she got another degree, an associate's degree, at Monroe Community College, in Computer Information Systems, again [graduating with distinction](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6183641-3c06-4c82-ba4d-662d0be0dbba). Later, she worked an additional job, one as a piano teacher giving individual lessons for a piano studio, and another as a part-time computer tutor in two different labs at the community college where she received her associate’s degree. My mom's students loved her in America, too. My mom taught me how to program when I took my first-ever computer science class, at the University of Rochester, since the professor wasn’t good. In fact, he was really bad. She taught me, through quick intuition, object-oriented programming, and helped me with projects and labs in Java. 

7 semesters later, I graduated with dual bachelors degrees, one in Computer Science and one in Mathematics. Thanks to work ethic and intelligence, that I inherited from my mom, and some luck, I got into a doctoral program.

Well, thanks also to my doctoral advisor, Henry.

Well, thanks also-also to my best friend, same one I mentioned before. He helped me edit together my statement of purpose and encouraged me as I took and re-took the GRE.

Unlike my mom not being able to in Uzbekistan, I got into the PhD program. I was gonna be a Doctor! I was gonna be the first Doctor of all of my *ancestors*, as far as I knew!

Before accepting me into his doctoral candidacy, Henry connected me to Charles Venuto at the Center for Health and Technology a year into their efforts to model Parkinson’s disease (PD) progression. Charles hired me as an undergrad researcher to work with another student, a friend of mine from an on-campus living community, in the UR Medicine Saunders Research Building, where I took on the responsibility of modeling Parkinson's disease for the next several years, including having co-led with that friend the PPMI Data Challenge project, a high-profile data contest hosted by the Michael J. Fox Foundation, which asked, "What factors at baseline predict clinical progression?"

Charles was my Med Center advisor.

Henry recommended me to the position to do disease modeling, while I was still an undergrad, predating all of the medical trauma, specifically, and entirely by coincidence, doing research in neurodegenerative disease modeling. "Neurodegenerative" means when the brain degenerates, for example, by chemical floodbaths of GABA from benzodiazepines and severe downregulation.

While I was working and researching under Charles, I had come up with, programmed, run the experiments for, and done most of the writing for the paper/contest-submission for a [disease prognostication machine learning model](https://github.com/slerman12/DiseaseModeling) that won top-three in the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research PPMI  contest, and came up with the idea of building a web app for the prognostication to give clinicians a clean, elegant interface. I had to argue a bit, and convince them, and then they let me, and, as a PhD student (in the early Fall of my third year, already in post-benzo withdrawal), [I even presented it at a conference in DC](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b77731f5-c99a-42f3-a3c2-811cadeb38a2) in front of reknowned researchers in the Parkinson's research field. Despite that being my idea and my [prototype](https://github.com/slerman12/DiseaseModelingWebApp), that I had to argue for, build, and present to make credible, all by myself, they liked it so much that they hired a web development team to build one, didn't put me on that team, and since have never given me credit. Charles also said they were going to patent it having even contacted a patent lawyer, and since have given me no information or updates about that either, or attributions or royalties.

I hope Charles and his colleagues may find the above diagram (["5 Computational Neurons"](#benzodiazepine-benzos-mechanism-of-action)) valuable in their work, ideally attributing credit. It ilucidates mechanisms of neurodegeneration biologically, computationally, and in psychiatric practice. 

But before we come to the conclusion that Charles is caught "red-handed," he was very supportive as my advisor; and he was left-handed, I recall, like my grandpa.

The Parkinson's disease progression models I built at the Med Center as an undergrad earned me a recommendation back to Henry Kautz, [as well as a news article](https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/undergraduate-students-place-in-top-three-in-parkinsons-disease-data-science-contest-228912/). On top of that, I built [a sleek website API for Twitter GNIP data mining](https://github.com/slerman12/TwitterDataCollector) for Henry's research group, and was praised by other affiliates of his that he recommended me to, at [Bryx emergency response](https://bryx.com). As a result, combined with my eclectic interests, he accepted me into his PhD group as a doctoral student.

After the hospitalization, it was from that couch (in early 2019) during a video call with my advisor (who was in DC) while on benzos that I described that biologically-inspired neuron architecture [above](#benzodiazepine-benzos-mechanism-of-action), with the specifics in the [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i5hS2iDVuo24PnGicvn5dIZYXUzDfPAl/view?usp=share_link) comparing it to the LSTM architecture.

I remember having video calls from my office with him too, teaching him "sequence-to-sequence attention" (even as I was working on innovations to MHDPA, now suffering due to grad-level classes, TAship, impending area exam, and not to mention brain damage) and being in a state of misery that I couldn't convey.

I passed my area exam, in my second PhD year, "with flying colors" according to Henry.

My advisor, Henry, didn't think deep learning was a fad, and had a sense of intuition about ideas like the biologically-inspired neuron in the diagram [above](#benzodiazepine-benzos-mechanism-of-action) though not always of involved ideas, like the use of attention mechanisms (e.g., MHDPA). My next advisor, my machine vision professor from my first year Chenliang Xu, technically wasn't in the room during the area exam, because he was answering the Skype call from China. He's the only person in the meeting who asked elaboration on how I planned to do "relational representations" for vision with image features from a CNN, since he didn't know what MHDPA was (neither did my NLP professor, who also did and oversaw work in deep learning, from the semester just before my hospitalization) and I went back to slide 11 and re-described MHDPA to all of them again, and the fact that Chenliang was the only one of them who showed interest in the method that most revolutionized the next years of their fields, is meaningful since he became my later advisor.  

The other faculty were mostly impressed by my "flying colors," as my personality was made vibrant by the benzos I had to take that day to function, but that’s not how Henry thought he meant it.

[My slides for that area exam were quite colorful](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LK0urIs8yu_e7HyZ-VQoDJUiGpPeTPEUgfhjK5Kw_7w/edit?usp=sharing), but that's also not how Henry meant it (see slide 11 for the description of MHDPA).

I rehearsed that area exam in front of my mom and uncle for a week every day before the area exam. At the area exam, I presented word by word as I rehearsed. My mom and uncle knew I was going to take a high dose of benzos that day. That was the plan. I even rehearsed one day in front of them at a smaller dose. They also knew. That was also the plan. (And, by the way, benzos were originally prescribed to me for social anxiety). That was one of two occasions during my greater-than-yearlong benzo withdrawal that I had to take a dose of benzos again to do something, 

> [!NOTE]
> the other being the poster presentation for the Medical Center, since that also involved cognitive performance in front of down-looking authorities in a higher-pressure requirement/opportunity with no other non-risky/non-embarassing way to do it.  Backtracking to main timeline...

My uncle was worried I wouldn't pass, and we all celebrated joyfully that I did. The area exam is the biggest defense of the University of Rochester CS department PhD program, other than the thesis. CS students at the University of Rochester are awarded a master's degree for a successful area exam defense, 60ish-page paper and oral, as was I! In my case, it only took my earlier stock of genius, an extremely dedicated human spirit fighting through impossible circumstances of brain damage on will alone, a genius paper that probably none of them read, and a big dose of benzos. 

My family besides me also had higher-level degrees. My mom, a master's degree in music theory. My uncles Slava and Sasha, PhDs, in physics and mathematics, respectively. My cousins, PhDs in dermatology and pharmacology. My sister, nurse practitioner (master's degree). And my best friend, also in a PhD program (immunology) but in another city. All were proud of me. None knew the details of the psychosis that led to the RGH hospitalization. Henry of course didn't either. This book is the real-time processing of that memory and the rest of these memories, all traumatic, into writing.

Henry got an offer to direct the AI division at the National Science Foundation in DC, which is an extremely prestigious role. So he accepted, after some time had to give up being my advisor, reassured me that his knowledge of deep learning wasn't good enough anyway, and directed me to switch to Chenliang Xu as my next advisor, who gave me an ultimatum about joining. I worked under Chenliang for 3 years, at which time he deserted.

### Chenliang Xu

I started losing my hair in my 1st year, I started taking benzos in my 2nd year, and I started working in Chenliang Xu’s lab nearing the end of my 3rd year.

For context, Henry's average paper count was 1 - 3 across the PhD student's full tenure. At the time of asking to join Chenliang's lab, the end of my 3rd year (near the end of Spring semester, 2020, before the university began Covid lockdowns), I had no publications.

Chenliang gave me an ultimatum: Submit a top-venue paper by end of summer, without pay, or no acceptance. Had I failed to do that, I wouldn't have an advisor or pay, and most likely, would've been terminated.

I presented Semantic Segmentation with MHDPA applied to image features. That, applied to a Computer Vision domain specifically, would've been the first Vision Transformer, but there wasn't enough time to build and benchmark that with the pressure and deadline from Chenliang.

I had to work at the Med Center concurrently for funding, since Chenliang wasn't paying me, and had to spend at least a month giving my nights and weekends to achieving his ultimatum by the summer, 2020 NeurIPS deadline.

He also said I'd have to come in every day to do that work in his lab, which I ended up not having to do due to the lockdowns.

He accepted me into his lab when I succesfully delivered that [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08601), my first published paper, "Taylor-CAM," ended up getting positive reviews, rejected, and then later accepted at ICCV, a top-venue conference (in AI, conferences are bigger than journals, and that was quite a feat for a few months, in a brand new research area, switching fields from "medical prognostication" to "state of the art computer vision").

It's ironic also that when he announced his desertion (due to not having published enough papers in that time frame), on ****07/24/2023****, 3 years later, I was in the middle of a paper review with positive reviews, [that got accepted](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-023-01164-8), another published paper.

During those 3 years, for the most part, Chenliang didn't directly fund me. At first I worked at the Medical Center. Then, he put me on a Mechanical Engineering lab, where I didn't work *instead of* his ordinary group requirements, but entirely on top of. In fact, none of the 3 committee members who the deciding Judge, and CS department Chair Michael Scott, attributed to my termination in my 6th year, addressed or acknowledged that I was working for and receiving funding for my work from the Mechanical Engineering department at the time, not from CS (meaning, the people who'll later terminate me, weren't the people giving me my paid work, technically at nearly any point; even prior to Chenliang was Med Center and an NSF grant that I applied for).

Meanwhile, under Niaz, in the Mechanical Engineering department, specifically Materials Science, I produced exactly the paper rate that she wanted, and through really hard work to make sure the ideas, experiments, grant-writing, data, and programming were all really high quality ([here is the GitHub repo I built for us](https://github.com/AGI-init/XRDs)).

Last-minute, and with almost no notice, and without Niaz's approval, Chenliang wanted to allocate that Mechanical Engineering-work funding to someone else, due to me not providing enough publications in his Computer Vision group. Yes that funding that I helped earn — literally — through the programming and grant ideas and grant writing and grant diagrams, definitively leading and exceptionally implementing the AI side of the work on which all of the models were built and experiments were run and plotted, as well as running and plotting the experiments, and with support and appreciation from the rest of the group as I taught them deep learning in each of our meetings every week, which included Chenliang — that funding to someone else. He'd given me no prior warning or indication of dissatisfaction. Quite the opposite actually.

As Niaz said, "I don't know what he was thinking."

Now some much-needed levity to an intense time period (how do I do this transition naturally?)...

### Comedic Aside: Sexier moments during Chenliang tenure:

Got to message someone named Tayler a week after my Taylor-CAM paper who reached out to me on Facebook who turned out to be a cam-girl (["Taylor-CAM"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08601))… 
- She was quite a synchronicity because she went through a similar thing that I did on the same Christmas, 2018 night, except together with a bald Jewish guy (who she was married to at the time), and our interaction began exactly one week after I first archived my ["Taylor-CAM"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08601) paper, my first-ever published paper. After intense flirting and telling me she loved me, including at one point offering to pay for my plane tickets to fly to her (which I couldn't do because of an eczema outbreak that coincided during the late summer, 2020), she lost interest in me and was hinting that she was seeing other guys.

> [!WARNING]
> ### Tayler
>  
> I felt something drained out of the purest part of my soul. I was so devastated. I got hospitalized again in October. That was the hospitalization that I resisted with combative attempts by fighting the police while I was in the grass where I was having a kind of spiritually-guided breakdown, following Tayler’s loss of interest in me. In the beginning journey of that hospitalization, I observed myself seeming convinced by the possibility that I was going through different dimensions, but I believed that they were all one dimension, one consistent reality, that I held faith to, the same rational one that I always knew, literally. But the meaning of that, interpreting years later like a kind of dream interpretation, could be varied. One is that I was losing my world because I was losing Tayler. My psychology was somehow intrinsically linked to that relationship, through our conversations and linguistics. Another, more Hallmark-card one (that is perhaps a bad-taste Christmas pun), is that I had gone "crazy for her," but literally. And that's true also. Another is about the nature of flirting and communication. The many dimensions and ambiguities of flirting, linguistics, phonetics and other symbolism. Yet another is that Tayler sent me a lot of messages, and now the universe was about to do the same.
>
> One of the dimensions was a lizard-person dimension, where some nurses were subjugated to others. Nurses to clinicians, rather, whose stature next to their clinical authorities was small and diminished, like they were being oppressed by a lizard race of people, in the future. Perhaps the meaning of that can be interpreted as the hierarchy relationships that our employment systems create, that on some deep subconscious level, mythologically, they are like a lizard-people relationship of rulers who've conquered the Earth, and humans with no agency under their tyranny.
>
> Another was a demon dimension. I did a yogically-guided "exorcism," as demons from the hospital's energies were popping on me. The nurse asked what I was doing when she caught me, moving and making the noises I was making (speaking in tongues, now that I think about it, maybe, but the tongues had semantics), and I said "exercising." She was satisfied with that answer. I think the message there was that exercise is good. Glad we could decipher that mystery — but actually, the yogic state of impersonating the energetic and linguistic forces that were inhabiting me, seemed to rid me of them and return me back to a flow state that was mine. Like doubling down on their corruptions to the point that they themselves become absurd and vanish. It worked.
>
> Another was a robot dimension. And the robot dimension I think was a message about the use of robots in hospitals, the terrible dissociation from humanity that comes from a robotic nurturer pretending to be human, cold and far from humane, or technology being either wrongly objectified or wrongly humanized vis a vis a cyborg.
>
> One was Tayler-tyranny one, where I was under her unforgiving judgement, debating her about something, some nature of a two-sided Kundalini, where somehow I was trying to defend that both are one (or more specifically, that the two can communicate).
>
> That's also literally where I started getting my [evolutionary learning ideas](https://github.com/slerman12/BuildingBlocks/blob/master/Population.py), with attention, which apparently to my surprise [had some positive results](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sw2Iu6foH3dmn-7a2JfijCljqheH_A3fEW5OuK-68Yg/edit?usp=sharing), though I don't even remember doing that. [I just remember having made this video](https://youtu.be/TEKgesBVTJ0?si=OtXQYMZgVd3Qu36M) (all within a pretty short time period after the hospitalization, and at this point Chenliang's group was becoming really impressed with me, and I was starting to build a good reputation, though that would only develop, occassionally me getting side-tracked with some other really good [ideas](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QbWNfnWAgm0rHTy4EFnDrjpaMP7Ako6isNxOUSR17_A/edit?usp=sharing) and/or implementations ([BioNet](https://github.com/slerman12/UnifiedMLold2/tree/master/Blocks/Architectures/LermanBlocks/BioNet), [ViRP](https://github.com/slerman12/UnifiedMLold2/blob/master/Blocks/Architectures/LermanBlocks/ViRP.py), or [Thousand Brains](https://github.com/slerman12/UnifiedMLold2/blob/master/Blocks/Architectures/LermanBlocks/ThousandBrains.py)), mysteriously always side-tracked despite my interest and usually some positive result, until when I was building UnifiedML (to be described below) — consistently over more than 2 years, finally not side-tracked, er, until I was terminated — they were pretty much in awe of me and I felt reasonably appreciated for the first time for my work). But distracting deep learning revelations aside, back to craziness: Traveling dimensions, debating hypothetical Tayler about some metaphysics philosophy... resume...
>
> Afterwards, I went through more interesting rituals with the nurses that I'll describe below under [Rituals, Religion, & Hell](#rituals-religion--hell).
>
> Lastly, after I was finally landed in the psychiatric unit, I met an older woman who Bar Mitzvah’d me. I should *maybe* put that in quotes.
>
> That inpatient got her dad to bring in a prayer sheet that he suggested I memorize for later recitation out loud. Over the next week or more, that inpatient — who curiously looked and sounded like a late 40s or early 50s Sarah — insisted I read it, and I had the instinct to, as she ritually sanctified it via sharing the same trance kind of state I was in in which we both sensed that I had to do that, as we both paced around the window end of the hallway, not far from everybody else, as I recited from memory and she like did her own intuitive ritualistic movements.
>
> I recall the prayer included the word "vitzivanu," but it was longer and ended differently than [this one](https://doingjewish.blog/2022/02/18/the-shabbat-candle-lighting-blessing-and-calling-on-the-ancestors-for-connection-and-wisdom/#:~:text=Baruch%20ata%20Adonai%2C%20Eloheinu%20Melech,commandment%20of%20lighting%20Shabbat%20candles.). Her dad (who did this of his and that inpatient's own accord) was actually Christian but he knew I was Jewish and the prayer he brought was Hebrew. Later, he came to visit that woman again, where he wanted me to recite it in front of him, and I did, from memory, as they'd wanted.
>
> In that hospitalization, I learned a tongue trick that I’m still impressed with myself by that allowed me to circumvent any medications, even though the nurses made you open your mouth and stick your tongue out both above and below. I got damn fast at making the switch of the pill from roof of my mouth to under my tongue. I'm gonna add an exclamation point, because that was worthy of some awe: !. Oh no, I sense a judgemental reader looming. Hello judgemental reader. Try a minimum of 2.5 mg of Ativan every day for 6 months and then come back to me with your judgements. But to emphasize, they literally made you show your mouth above your tongue and below, and somehow I flipped the medications fast enough to keep both "ahhhh"s from betraying my dexterous deceit / sleight of hand. 
>
> It was also one of the last hospitalizations for me, ever. And it was a good one because — controversially or not, this did make a difference: I got to escape taking too many synthetic medicines via the tongue trick, and the nurses were all my age and beautiful, which is an understated human medical need, and I was severely lacking that kind of warmth through almost all of my PhD.
>
> That other inpatient who looked like an older Sarah, who narrativized it via her dad, made the experience a sacred non-delusion, and neither of us made the connection that that Hebrew prayer might’ve been a Bar Mitzvah (perhaps that’s stupid of me) until I kind of connected the dots of this context years later.
>
> Those kinds of ritualistic non-gaslighting shared interpretations do far more to heal a person from the underlying causes of their mental breakdown than medications, as proved to be the case for me. I actually happened to call Tayler from that hospitalization, even manically told her "I’m Jesus," as my linguistics seemed to literally guide themselves on their own, blissfully, and she somehow took me back temporarily after that (into her flirting DMs), until our shared birthday week, at which time, since I guess I was a certified man by all "good enough" synthetic metaphorical Bar Mitzvah standards, I guess I was ready for the ultimate coming of age ritual: being blocked by a beautiful woman I really like (she was the first, or at most second, person to have ever blocked me). 
> - Yes, our birthdays coincided. Well, week-wise. She was a couple years younger than me. 
> - I bring this up because our interaction started exactly a week after I archived my Taylor-CAM paper, and she suffered a trauma on Christmas, 2018, together with a bald Jewish guy, in addition to her being named Tayler and a cam-girl, and our birthdays coinciding, [and other "coincidences" as well](https://github.com/animal-tree/SuspiciousnessofSynchronicitiesAndParanoia/blob/main/Does-anyone-else-think-this-is-proof-of-God%3F.md).
> - See [Intimacy healing](#intimacy-healing) for what the meaning of this might be.
>
> Regarding the beautiful nurses, I even got reprimanded for trying to flirt with one of them by writing my phone number on an attendance sheet, inspired somewhat by Tayler’s personality, and got patronizingly lectured by a man about respecting the women nurses in the hospital, despite him and the hospital staff being the ones in the position of authority, me being held captive and drugged there against my will (by them), cameras and police everywhere, and me neither wanting to be there nor feeling comfortable. But, in my defense, in case I somehow come out like the predator in this calculus, the flirting was from a manic delusion type thing, yogic-type sense that I had to. In none of these hospitalizations was I acting on any primitive (read: "for pleasure") impulses, nor through any of this. The whole time I was under the sense or deluded belief that Tayler’s spirit was the one governing this, but that turned out [maybe](https://github.com/animal-tree/SuspiciousnessofSynchronicitiesAndParanoia/tree/main) unvalidated, and I came out lucid without that mania or deluded belief, having unknowingly undergone a meaningful ritual with a fellow inpatient, and not consumed any pills except maybe small traces. That was also the hospitalization where I met Mobi, the 16 year old with drug problems who they drugged with benzos for years.
>
> The [next one was in a geriatric unit (a facility for the elderly)](#geriatric-unit-hospitalization), so consider me reprimanded.

On the note of synchronicities:

- Waxed wise with a close friend ([Jeremiah](#hospitalization)) who I met on a trip to Israel many years back — someone who rather serendipitously was seated next to me on that plane — about reinforcement learning on Facebook, reconnected, and at his birthday party ran into someone who my religious friend (different guy incidentally, Josiah) introduced me to years ago, who I then kept running into the next weeks at the beach literally by just remarkable luck, and each usually-accidental date we had was like a reinforcement learning episode, of me trying to listen to my subconscious and instinct, and getting rewarded or punished and ultimately the world’s lowest ever score aside from one much needed hug! We were both RL agents in that one (no not ["reinforcement learning agents"](https://github.com/slerman12/UnifiedMLold2/tree/master/Agents), "real life agents")! The fun never ends. 
- The next summer I got another miraculous house situation where this really attractive person my age gave me a house rental without a lease with her lesbian roommate (roommates plural ‘cause girlfriend) and no background checks, where I came up with my [BittleBot idea with the methodology of using YouTube](https://github.com/AGI-init/Tributaries/blob/73e95d5006438f678507d0067025e484e66c6e73/Examples/Sweeps/Bittle.py#L11), and she was like a famous YouTuber, and not even the first talented YouTuber I got to meet (the other one by chance while I was editing [a YouTube video](https://youtu.be/VKoSfmECpx0?si=6PNBfaqbE-iY_GV8) in the park)! Then we never talked again (except the second person who I ran into a few years later, by a [physics-subverting](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-023-01164-8) precognitive sense that I can’t even describe here, who I talked to around the theme of "fire" just before I wrote [this essay about fire](Philosophy/Fire.md) and Chenliang called me in to notify/"fire" me I didn’t get him enough papers — not sure what that would’ve entailed considering the statistically significant correlations of all of these probably deserving [their own interrogation of p-value](https://github.com/animal-tree/SuspiciousnessofSynchronicitiesAndParanoia/blob/main/quackery.md)).
- Somebody I was texting, who I knew from undergrad, was planning to go to Acadia National Park with me, and that inspired me to call my [rQdia paper](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C33&q=rqdia&btnG=) "rQdia" (pronounced Arcadia), but that one was on purpose, and it was rejected, and we ended up not going (it’s still in the not-really-planned-but-hypothetical books)!

Well, I suppose there was the thanksgiving with Sarah (see [in next chapter](#Intimacy-healing)), which I also appreciated and appreciate and give thanks to.

### More seriously

#### Rituals, Religion, & Hell

One of the most powerful rituals was during the Bar Mitzvah hospitalization. When they first brought me in, before the psychiatric unit, I was held in some various different rooms. One of them, was part of a hallway where there was a male nurse sitting outside, who looked just like my best friend. He even had a nametag that I think was my best friend's first name, so I vaguely recall. I knew it wasn't my best friend, but somehow led him in a ritual, that he willingly participated in. The state I was in was shamanic. He was about my age and let me speak to him as if I was speaking to my best friend, as he literally sat on the floor when I told him to and followed my every instruction. I was playful and had unambiguous humor and self awareness in my voice. I understood the nurse wasn't literally him, my best friend who I projected not-fully-intentionally.

Later, as I walked along that hallway — I don't know if it was a psychiatric unit or what — I was the only patient and there were many nurses — I kind of led the female nurses in a ritual, too. Each one I saw, I looked into her eyes and said the name of the family member or friend who I saw in them, as if literally my family was appearing in them in spirit. I was seeing beyond them individually, and they sensed it. At one point, I even put my hand slowly to one female nurse's rib, intimately and non-sexually. She stood still. All of the nurses stood still. There was even a big male nurse. 

A ritual was happening that couldn't be desecrated or remarked upon. No clinical logic could destroy it.

The theme of my best friend returned in the next hospitalization, in the geriatric unit (elderly facility) one, where I imagined him as the Devil, but that schizophrenic-like delusion was the least Hellish thing about that hospitalization (described later [below](#geriatric-unit-hospitalization), after five short detours), and I thought I was literally condemned in Hell, literally in Hell and I would never see humanity or good again. Having somebody I can trust — despite being imagined — play the role of the most fearful part of that trauma, made the actual Hellishness of that hospitalization less Hellish. The delusion, in spite of the environment, was good.

It's the delusion that doctors and hospitals are trying to heal. However, in that example, it was the doctors and hospital who were creating a Hell, and the delusion was the only healing part of it. In that delusion, he was quite snarky.

Later, my best friend returned, literally. We were texting and he remarked, without prompt, saying if he were a Devil, he'd be a "snarky Devil." He texted me that of his own accord, knowing nothing about the hospitalization, no context, no prompt.

#### Mobi

5 years since the Christmas, 2018 psychosis, my instincts still have not ceased, though I interpret them as a different intelligence than "God" and the "threats" have evolved into helpful or slightly sabotaging suggestions, what others with frontal lobes might just observe in themselves, less acutely, as "social energies, social sense, social skill, maybe emotional intelligence, or emotion," and frontal lobes should, as a general rule of thumb, be handled delicately when just growing in, by the way, as they tend to in a person's early 20s, when by totally-random-amazing-coincidence, schizophrenic episodes are most likely to occur in a person whose relationships with those energies of their intelligence might not be as integrated as with other impressive energies of their intelligence, and that integration can be initially exactly as intense as it's supposed to be minus the external orders that make it quite paranoid and scary — did I just explain schizophrenia in one sentence? Anyway, that truth about not intervening while parts are still growing in, is a quintuply true about people under 20.

I met Mobi in my Bar Mitzvah hospitalization (2 years since the Christmas, 2018 psychosis), a kid who'd done nothing wrong except succumb to drug withdrawal. A couple years later, I learned that Sarah had met Mobi in one of their hospitalizations, too, that he'd even braided Sarah's hair. We were all connected. Mobi was a recurrent inpatient care unit psychiatric recipient. He was 16, clearly intelligent, had a "sober" intelligence and humor, was respectful, kind, and chill. They'd been giving him benzos for 2 years at that point, on and perhaps-sporadically-off, from the age of about 14, and he was in there mainly, or perhaps only, for drug problems and addiction. Acclimating to benzos, one's brain becomes deprived of GABA and will crave something, usually drugs, to take the literal neural edge off, to silence those disproportionate Glutamates and other action potentials whose balancing complement, GABA, is downregulated, throughout the brain. Benzos are a hard drug, and are as addictive as any hard drug. He was a 16-year-old drug addict, and they kept institutionalizing him for his drug issues and prescribing daily benzos. 

#### I didn't mention fingernails (fingernails regrowth)

In Moscow, during the Nazi attack, my grandma and her older sister, while they were little girls (my grandma was 13 and my great Aunt Tsilia was 18), threw fire bombs off the roof of their dad's and step mother's house, that the Nazi planes were dropping fire bombs on, meant to burn the houses. Their dad was fighting in the war front; their mother had died when my grandma was 5 and her sister was 10, from typhus, a very bad infectious disease. Their step mother was sick with tuberculosis; and their little younger step-brother Yura was too young to help with throwing the fire bombs. [Note: This description came from memory. A primary source description is quoted below. I'll add a link to the rest of the interview later.].

> Moscow was bombed every day, sometimes multiple times a day. 500 airplanes bombed the city in one day. Not only bombs, but also a lot of lighters were thrown from the airplanes. The alarm of the air raid required everyone to step down to the underground [bomb shelters], and I went there too. But if the air raid came at the time of our work shift, we, all working at the armory children [factory of defense], climbed on the roof. Our responsibility was to take the hot lighters and throw them off the roof, to prevent a fire.

> Also, the voice interview with my grandpa.

My grandma was about 24 when she and my grandpa arrived to Samarkand.  She was a German language teacher, before my uncle was born. She didn't know German, but she knew Yiddish, so she accepted the job, since Yiddish is close to German. Later, she was a teacher of Russian language and Russian literature, separate fields. Later, she was an academic principle of a school and continued teaching.

My grandma had long grey hair, down to almost her waist or hips. She curled it up behind her head with hair pins, like in a bun but prettier.

She told me when we were sitting in the backseat of the car, perhaps when we were going with my mom and grandpa to the pool at JCC, that I had her fingernails, perhaps unusual. I also take her eyes, and my mom's eyes. I got a girlfriend temporarily in 2016, the semester that my grandma died, who remarked on my cuticles. I didn't know what those were, but apparently I didn't cut them. Also an unusual remark, at an important juncture involving my grandma, that I remember. 

Anyway, in addition to losing all of my hair — head, eyebrows, and eyelashes — due to the Dupilumab cessation, I also lost my fingernails in functionality in 2018, also unambiguously due to the Dupilumab cessation. They regrew, healthily functional enough, after being purple, and bendy like putty, for a really long time, maybe into 2019. 

#### How my grandma got dementia

My grandma was prescribed a cocktail of neuroactive drugs before she had dementia. Seroquel, Lyrica, Xanax, and the list goes on. She didn't have any of the conditions those medications are primarily supposed to treat (Seroquel is an antipsychotic, Lyrica is an antiepileptic, Xanax is a benzo), and every time she developed a new symptom from one, they prescribed yet another. She developed dementia when I was still in high school. She lived with dementia from then to my Junior year of college, the year my grandpa died, 2016, when she died as well.

#### How my grandpa died

When I was a kid, I listed off my favorite family members once, in my order of favorite, in front of all of them who were in our apartment living room, either standing or eating at the table. Maybe I was 5 or so. I remember they all looked big and I was standing. Grandpa was sitting in his bigger chair at the table and I started, "Babula" ("Grandma"), "Máma," "Marina," ... and then after all the others who I listed, I listed my grandpa. I still remember that. He wasn’t offended, and I love and loved my grandpa a lot. In maybe 16 years, I would be standing by his bedside in the hospital, after a heart surgery he had, when he'd tell me: "Ti moy lyubimey v'nuk" ("You are my favorite grandson."). He has 4 grandkids: Irina, Lena, Marina, and me. I'm his only grandson... 

I remember sitting by my grandpa's bedside, alternating days and nights. My mom or I were needed there at all times. He was almost 88, and the languages he spoke were Russian, Ukrainian, and Yiddish, and he was legally blind. He and I couldn’t watch the same TV when he lived with us, because he neither spoke English nor could see, but sometimes when I visited my grandma's and his apartment unit immediately across from ours (after they’d moved, since originally we lived together), we watched Russian Television Network together, and they actually got some Cable channels from the government program, as well. In my apartment, we only had ABC, FOX, NBC, CBS, and PBS. With high school and college, I had, uh, resourcefulness, and Netflix. During those days and nights at his bedside in the hospital, in the hospital recline chair next to him, I watched a lot of Doctor Who on Netflix on my laptop, a show about an alien with two hearts called The Doctor that resurrects after each death, the previous generation surviving in the next, and the next, and the next. It’s the [longest running science fiction show in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who#:~:text=The%20series%20has%20been%20listed,ratings%2C%20DVD%20and%20book%20sales.), a show that originally started with an old grandpa.

My grandpa survived two heart attacks previously, one in Uzbekistan and one in America. 

Here is how he ended up in the hospital: Sometime in the month of November, in 2015, he was having trouble breathing, my mom took him to his primary care doctor, she diagnosed him with congestive heart failure, she prescribed pills, then about a month and a week of taking pills later, he was still having trouble breathing, my mom took him to the hospital, they took a blood analysis, and apparently he'd had a third heart attack, that occurred about a week before. So my grandpa's heart doctor came into the hospital, recommended a stent be put in my grandpa’s heart's main artery, via a surgery, and that the surgery would use an angiogram. The angiogram would require a dye that is bad for the kidneys. The primary care physician wanted to discharge my grandpa and send him for rehabilitation already, without the surgery; the heart doctor told my mom "without the surgery, his heart would only get worse" and that "he'd only have heart attacks and eventually die," so my mom chose to listen to the heart doctor, they did the angiogram, they tried to do the surgery, but the main artery was completely blocked, the surgeon wasn't able to do the surgery so put stents into the little arteries that were narrow but weren't the cause of the congestive heart failure, and right after the surgery, which required an angiogram, which used the dye that was bad for the kidneys, my grandpa's kidneys got so bad he couldn't walk at all anymore; he couldn't stand up on his feet.

I was visiting him on alternating nights before and after the surgery. Then, after the New Year 2016, the hospital didn’t know what do with him, discharged him, and sent him to the Jewish home for rehabilitation, for physical therapy to help with his worsened kidneys. They also scheduled a follow-up appointment with his heart doctor in that heart doctor's private office, separate from both the hospital and Jewish home, in a different location from either, for January 21, 2016.

My grandpa was a self-reliant man, but the transit two weeks later on January 21, 2016 from the Jewish home to that heart doctor's office was extreme. My mom was there, and it was a big ordeal just to help him stand amid the kidney problems that were causing him difficulty moving. How big a toll that transfer of locations took: they resorted to using an elevating machine that lifted him, an almost 88 year old man, up from his bed. 

"Why was he discharged from the hospital?" the heart doctor had asked at that appointment in his office. "In this condition, he should be in the hospital."

My grandpa's heart failed that night, after the grueling trial to make the heart doctor appointment, in all likelihood because of that grueling trial. His official death was technically the night (morning) after that heart doctor appointment, January 22, 2016.

My grandpa was not one to miss a grueling transit. On July 3, 1941, my grandpa, his mom Mañá, and his younger sister Rosá evacuated Ukraine. They went place to place by train, lived in different places, worked at farms. Once, they took the train from Rostov, and the train stopped. My grandpa was young, maybe 14. He thought, "I’ll go to the market nearby and buy something." He bought a little bit of bread and kielbasa. When he came back, he discovered his train already left. So he asked people. They said, "There’s a place where those trains stop. You can go there and take another train; they go the same direction, so maybe you can catch up with your previous train," and he saw, one train had already started moving, one train there on that platform, already in motion, and he decided he could jump, so he jumped. He was holding on, but he was gonna fall, and he thought he was gonna fall under the train. But there was someone who picked him up, quickly pulled him on (elevated him onto this big mechanical machine), someone on that train, someone who was there who quickly pulled him up. He ended up making it to their previous train's destination before his mom and sister, waiting for them, as theirs which had more stops in their transit’s journey, arrived after him.

This time, my grandpa arrived a little before my grandma, despite being a little younger, in the same year, just a few months before.

In Uzbekistan, it was custom for doctors to visit patients. Physicians always came to patient homes, or wherever the patient was, standardly, in Uzbek healthcare. But America and Uzbekistan had something in common, regarding their healthcare systems: cardiologists (heart doctors) specifically, didn’t visit patient homes. In our neighboring apartment units, my grandpa was having trouble breathing, but could still walk, and had survived three heart attacks previous to his death. Perhaps the heart doctor was right, and he'd keep having heart attacks and eventually die, but eventually was the night of their appointment, after a heroic ordeal to get to that office that my grandpa, with heavy strain, survived, and made it back in time to the Jewish home for his final destination, earlier than had he never gotten off the first train.

#### When my grandma died

My grandma, Asya Lerman (Hebrew/American: "Esya") always cooked, healthy and really well, but she had type-2 diabetes at old age.
I remember, for herself, she had to use artificial sweeteners because she couldn’t eat pure sugar.
She also made these delicious Russian cookies for us called "Korshike," that I loved, that she also put into these different mold shapes, hearts and stars and fish and circles. I liked to eat the raw dough sometimes, but she didn’t let me eat it in large quantities because of eggs and the risk of salmonella.

I had healthier food than the average American as a kid, despite my family’s poverty, but I still had eczema, allergies, and asthma through my whole childhood.

My grandma taught my mom dancing when they were younger, in Uzbekistan. Seeing my grandpa bedridden in the hospital, even before the surgery, it was obvious to me that he was losing strength, just from the sedentary confinement to bed, that the doctors put him in, in a corner of a concrete-surrounded hospital, with no natural light, nature, or fresh air. He would’ve benefited from some motion, out of bed and walking, outdoors, with nature, with fresh air. At least once a day, each day, without any grueling transits to reach such an environment.

I really think had the hospital recommended my grandpa an organic steak/salmon-only diet, and nothing more, they possibly could’ve saved his main artery from being blocked, without a surgery. Then no stents would be put into his healthier narrow arteries, no damaged kidneys, no grueling transit to heart doctor. Just physical therapy and rehabilitation. And maybe many more years, living beyond my grandma.
- The idea that red meat causes anything, has never been investigated in the context of organic, grass fed, grass-finished, and wild-caught meat, exclusive. High quality medicine that 2.4 million years in the Ice Age should give nutritionists some hint to, and cheaper than the entire benzo industry.
- Inorganic factory-sourced industries aren’t sufficiently out-competed by their ethical organic, counterparts, which is unethical both to the animals and the people eating them.
- This diet, of organic, grass fed, grass-finished steak and wild-caught salmon, probably, would've cured my grandma's diabetes.
- I haven't found any risks like mercury poisoning to be an issue, but that's why latitudinal studies are needed. I didn't eat more than one salmon per day usually. Often fresh, almost always wild-caught, with no other interacting chemicals, besides allowing myself salt and black pepper.
- A proper nutrition study that investigates interacting chemicals, requires a combinatorially intractable number of control variables (and in this case, a lot of money), rarely accounted for in nutrition studies. This inadvertent study, longitudinally, resulted in at least 3 measured breakthrough results, across a span of 6 years, and others harder to measure objectively, on a population of me.

She shortly outlived my grandpa, and died the same year as him **three days before** his April 16 birthday, on April 13, 2016.

I suppose she’d’ve had to forestall her death as well, then, seeing she died just a few months after he died, in the same year, as if on purpose, joining him exactly 3 days before his April 16 birthday, on April 13, 2016, where 13 both symbolizes a death kind of day and has the number 3, as in 3 days before, and 2016 has the number 16, the upcoming day of my grandpa’s birthday.

She couldn’t have died on a more perfect day, except if my grandpa lived a many, many years longer.

My grandpa also gets two claims to rhythmic numerical timing: (1) He entered the hospital on December 22, 2015, spent two weeks in the hospital, two weeks in the Jewish home, and then died exactly a month after, on January 22, 2016, (2) He, Yury Lerman, was born "Izya"; but during the war, as documents were lost and "Izya" was a Jewish name amid an extremely anti-semitic Ukraine, he called himself "Yura," or the full name, "Yury," and that became his new name with the new documents when he was about 16, the same age (16 again) as my name was officially changed to "Sam" actually, by amazing ancestral-but-unintended rhyme.

Now for some stretchier synchronicities:

As for my grandma, the number 13 also includes a number that "is less than 3," e.g. a heart <3, which a modern readership might be able to visually appreciate universally across languages, having been a teacher of varied languages, including Ukrainian, Russian, Yiddish, and German (and she also learned English after we immigrated), in her life.

Besides 16, another synchronistic number is 7. My grandma was born March 25, 1927. My mom was born July 17, 1957 (07/17/57). And Irina, who takes the most from my grandma besides me, was born November 17, one day and 6 years apart from my birthday. And my grandpa was 87 when he died.

And 2016 has the number 16, that, besides being the upcoming day of my grandpa’s birthday, was the beginning of a larger-scope revolution in politics, and reformed perceptions of the healthcare system, with the 2016 ascent of another, similar Jewish old-grandpa type character and role model to me, Bernie Sanders, who has some similarities to my grandpa. 

My grandma’s numerical timing of when she died is a proof symbol in my opinion on the perception and characterized message of my grandpa’s death involving the heart doctor seeming synchronistic: that the healthcare system needs reform. And the ascent of Bernie, whose name slantly rhymes with "Yury," immediately after, means a lot to me about the need for reforming healthcare systems, not just in governance, but inside the systems themselves, from elderly care, to prescription habits, to the dietary and environment principles. 

I think Tayler screwed up the symbolism, whatever the universe meant of it, when she "blocked my heart" approximately on my birthday… She was 22 (the day my grandpa died), she blocked my heart (as my grandpa’s was), and, also unlike my grandma, rather than joining me finally at that time, that’s when she left. The symbolism was the exact reverse, perhaps signifying strongly that she was very much (though sadly) not "the one."

I had severe eczema, and my grandma when I was a kid helped by giving the best massages, and my mom and grandpa too. Tayler may have symbolically pointed to one more aspect of the medical system that might need a revolutionary radical innovation, one that will be discussed, succinctly, later… (See ["Intimacy healing"](#intimacy-healing)).

#### Ascent of a Jewish old grandpa

In 2016, Bernie Sanders was the first presidential candidate I was old enough to vote for, and I voted for him.

I wanted to donate to his campaign [early](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/bu8N4jvNp9As7Rs1/), from a link in one of his emails. My mom cautioned me that the email might've been spam because my description sounded too good to be true. He wasn’t a household name yet. She doesn’t think that anymore. We both ended up donating, multiple times. But he was an unlikely figure in any politics, American or otherwise, devoted to principled [governance](https://github.com/animal-tree/Governance/blob/main/Does-Nature-Endorse%3F.md), e.g. universal healthcare, not politics.

The girlfriend I mentioned earlier, [who remarked on my cuticles](#i-didnt-mention-fingernails-fingernails-regrowth), that rhymed with my grandma’s perhaps unusual remark about our fingernails, and I, actually bonded because of our shared love of Bernie Sanders, in 2016, the same semester my grandma had joined my grandpa at the platform of his last train, where her Medicare benefits were finally relinquished to the world, joining his up in the Health Care Financing Administration (pronounced "HeCk-FAn").

But I bring him up now because the rest of this book is going to point to some serious problems more specifically, and address the specific reforms I've been referencing, specifically. These are reforms that aren't redundant to the ones Bernie Sanders has already pointed out, and unlike many bleeding-hearts who’ve copied him since, I’m sincere, and mine is gushing to the floor, with an ancestral main artery that has proved itself strong enough to hold the blood back or translate that heart into a universal language. How to transition into this? Well...

Speaking of the elderly...

#### Geriatric unit hospitalization

> [!WARNING]
> In December, 2020, about a month after Tayler blocked me, I had another hospitalization, my last hospitalization, the geriatric unit (elderly facility) one.
>
> I was leading another one of Chenliang's students on a long-term memory paper called [Eclectic-Mem](https://github.com/slerman12/Eclectic-Mem) for Chenliang, that I still had an extremely intense amount of work to do on in order to make the ICML deadline. My family members visited. I was again following some kind of yogic-trance, but this time, much less spiritually guided. I knew that the yogic state I'd been in before was real, and I didn't want to disobey the new flow that had taken over. I was acting strange in front of the visiting family members, and my mom called the ambulance. My behavior was strange enough that the responders decided to take me to the hospital, and as they were doing so, I broke from the obedience to that pseudo-flow state and started screaming to my mom that there was an ICML paper deadline that I had to submit to. This was still 2020, months after the Taylor-CAM paper. The responders took me away, so far with no concrete reason to do so, but only my mom's call and the superficial strangeness of my behavior.
>
> In particular, what caused my mom to call the ambulance was I was doing stretches on the couch without talking to my relatives when they were talking to me. Then the strange behavior with responders, who I did talk to, and whose questions I answered normally, was that I was slightly reluctant to let them take my vitals — yes. And I quickly did let them take my vitals. They just caught that I had some reluctance and found that suspicious. So they dragged me to the ambulance, and I was screaming to my mom about the paper deadline as they did so. The ambulance drove me to the hospital, where first, they brought me to a lobby.
>
> In the lobby, the nurse pulled me behind a curtain and made me change clothes, and I didn't want to (was slightly reluctant), but she told me I had to. Then she sat me in a wheelchair. A nurse pushed it forward, it ran over my big toe, and I screamed out specifically that my toe was run over. The nurse kept rolling me off, as she and the other nurses all ignored my screaming, in what, surprisingly, didn't break my toe. 
>
> Next, they brought me to an open area filled with other patients, and told me I'd be transferred later that day.
>
> Each day I was told I’d be transferred that day or the next day. I had to sleep there in a chair for a week. The dungeon-like area was full, in every square foot of the open areas, with other patients, who slept on mattresses or also in chairs. The clinicians seemed to forget about me and still had no particular reason for the imprisonment.
>
> Besides the clothes they’d made me change into, I was given only highly processed foods to eat, foods that usually cause eczema, drugs including benzos, and periodic clinical visits from clinicians who could've been mistaken for military interrogators. Clinical authorities.
>
> None of them were consistent or attendant enough to see this, but I was in an increasingly sensitive state, as I was coerced through all of this, knowing-unjustly, and with no normal sleep for a week.
>
> After a week of sleeping in a chair, they transferred me to the geriatric unit (a facility for the elderly) on a different floor, their regular psychiatric units being full.
>
> Finally, they specified a reason for why they were holding me. Apparently my mom said I wasn't eating enough, which she later denied saying. Ironically, I was eating a lot. Usually 5 organic steaks and a salmon every day, about half of my income. I was lectured pretty heavily by a fat woman specialist about how carbs are a necessary part of a healthy diet. That was Winter, 2020/2021, perhaps just before diets like the keto diet gained scientific support, or maybe already after. During that hospitalization, chunks of my hair fell out. The rapid timing was extremely coincidental, so maybe the onset of the hair loss was independent to the hospitalization, or maybe a synchronicity, but most likely exacerbated, because I thought I was in Hell.
> 
> The anxiety was so extreme that my eczema became itchy just from that, if not the food. I ate all of their garbage food. I made special requests, but the diet they provided wasn't more than what you'd expect from hospital food, and always came with an abundance of chocolate Ensures, enough to probably buy a steak honestly.
> 
> Due to Covid, my family wasn’t allowed to visit me.
>
> Of all the hospitalizations (excluding aftermath, e.g., benzos trauma), the most traumatic was the geriatric unit one. And not because they ran over my toe with the wheelchair that I was in and ignored my pained screams, nor the enclosed-dungeon area where they made me sleep in a chair for a week, eat stuff I was allergic too, take benzos temporarily again, and share living space amid lots of commotion and tons of people, but because of the geriatric unit they subsequently transferred me to. Old people. People I thought were sketchy. One friend, black guy I shared pudding crackers with at the window later, after, when I managed to get out of my room from the trauma of thinking I was in Hell. Other than that, coldness, Hell-setting, and, while I was still confined to my bed due to the intensity of the earlier dungeon area where they kept saying they'd transfer me to a room later that day and didn't for another week, I was under the delusion in that geriatric unit environment that I was literally in Hell, the beam of red light shining into my window from the neighboring hospital roof, being stuck in a floor with no nature, old lady in the room next door screaming "Oh Christia! Oh Christia!" every day, only plastic and children's colors and an artificial picture painting across from my door. And I had a whole bed and bathroom to myself, but still. The nurses and staff were fine, but the environment was bad.
>
> That was the geriatric unit hospitalization, psychiatric wards were full, ran over my toe, they kept me in an open-room with other patients, and then after like a week of me sleeping in a chair, they transferred me to a geriatric unit, with me unable to leave my bed through New Year’s because I thought I was in Hell, once they situated me in that geriatric unit room, no visitors. They had no knowledge of that Hell thinking, nor was that my state of thinking coming into the hospitalization. 
>
> I wasn’t risking the tongue trick from before to spit out the benzos. I wasn’t in that kind of flow state. But perhaps all of this was my fault because, later, when they gave me a Covid mask, in the geriatric unit, which I don't recall if they did while in the open area with other patients, I got to spit the benzos out into that.
>
> I think they did a Covid test before transferring me, though I don't recall one. I'm just inferring, since it was a geriatric unit (a unit for the elderly). Yes, I recall mention of a Covid test. I don't know if it was before or after the dungeon-area.
>
> To summarize:
> - My big toe was painfully run over by the nurse, and ignored, no attention paid, disregarded screaming.
> - I had to sleep in a chair in a shared open area filled with other patients for a week with only scary clinical authorities who came around occasionally to interrogate me, drugs handed to me, and with food only that I was allergic to, while in an increasingly sensitive state, and being told I'd be transferred to a room later that day or the next day.
> - I was transferred to a geriatric unit, with almost nobody my age, and an environment that lacked any nature, with only synthetic plastics, no genuine warmth, and an abundance of chocolate Ensures.
> - I was lectured about not eating enough carbs.
> - My hair was falling out into my hands and my eczema returned.

Then they have no choice but to let those clinicians strap them or inject them or whatever, and their mind possibly is tuned to a ritual level of thinking where symbolism has extreme sacred meaning. The symbolism of "vitals" being "taken," in the context of vampyrism or losing a loved one, isn't good. Just a suggestion.

There was one hospitalization half a year later, in which I was there for half a day, but they neither held me there nor believed there was any psychiatric issue. The geriatric unit hospitalization was traumatizing, but that's not the reason why I successfully avoided future imprisonments. My ability to live with those schizophrenic states (trances, including less trustworthy ones), consciously and drug-free, increased to the point that they aren't schizophrenic states, but unambiguous connections to a deeper wisdom (or, some "intelligence" of some kind, depending what social influences are most authoritatively in my life). [Humans and other cultures have been integrating that wisdom long before hospitals existed.](https://youtu.be/CFtsHf1lVI4?si=c7HOzpchsB2NeP1-) Though this geriatric unit hospitalization isn't a good example, I was and have become pretty good at navigating those states of consciousness and integrating them in the moment, usefully, creatively, and sometimes powerfully.

> Nor Hollywood, even. At the end of [A Beautiful Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind_(film)), the nobel prizewinner with schizophrenia, John Nash, is depicted as achieving stability by taking his medications. The real John Nash objected to them, and lived pretty much his entire life unmedicated, starting from long before he came up with the work that led to his winning the Nobel Prize. While the movie's depiction is somehow extremely romantic to medical systems, it's inaccurate to the true history of how he surmounted his diagnoses. ["In Sylvia Nasar’s book with the same title, on which the film is based, it is clearly stated that Nash stopped taking medication in 1970 because of the way it blunted his intellect. The change was apparently made because the screenwriter, Akiva Goldsman, whose mother was a prominent psychologist, was worried that the film might persuade people to stop taking their medication."](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/02/dont-use-john-nash-schizophrenia-a-beautiful-mind-promote-anti-psychotics) Yes, the film based on a true story might persuade people wrongly. So better fabricate it. ["in a scene [around the time of the character's Nobel nomination in 1994], Russell Crowe explicitly credits his recovery [...] to newer medication. The truth is that Nash stopped taking any medication in 1970. The line is a fabrication, and a conscious one."](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/02/dont-use-john-nash-schizophrenia-a-beautiful-mind-promote-anti-psychotics)

> ["Nash described sanity as a form of conformity, and one about which he maintained a degree of ambivalence. 'So, at the present time, I seem to be thinking rationally in the style that is characteristic of scientists,' he wrote. 'However, this is not entirely a matter of joy, as if someone returned from physical disability to good physical health. One aspect of this is that rationality of thought imposes a limit on a person’s concept of his relation to the cosmos.' There can be no doubt that to talk in such terms requires both honesty and tremendous courage. The question is whether we have the courage to hear him."](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/02/dont-use-john-nash-schizophrenia-a-beautiful-mind-promote-anti-psychotics)

To do: Make a diagram specifically for geriatric unit hospitalization (University of Rochester's Strong Hospital).

Chronology: Lobby wheelchair toe -> open-area chair sleeping with processed eczema-causing food, more coerced benzos, and interrogative military clinicians -> geriatric unit -> them arguing carbs were a necessary part of a healthy diet and stating that the reason for holding me in that hospitalization was that I wasn't eating enough (even as I ate all of their garbage food).

#### Warmth, nature, and organic-type foods

I didn’t eat steak, because of course they couldn’t afford it. Could you imagine if hospitals served grassfed, grass-finished organic steak? I was on a PhD student budget and spent my salary, despite savings, on mostly just steak/fish (with some Paleo leniency) and gas each month. But hospitals spend their wealth on drugs and chocolate Ensures. And that’s when my hair fell out, and my eczema started returning. That's point 2. (Glossing over the environment-setting point, nature, fresh air, hiking, camping, etc.). That last point, hidden in the parenthetical, deserves its own book, and might be getting one.

#### Schools

Let's now regress back to childhood.

Many of the problems that exist in hospitals also exist in public and private education systems. Kids are being put through concentration camps. These environments should be more like summer camps, monasteries, or Hogwarts — filled with nature and healthy food — not Nazi prisons. Literally concentration camps is what our society puts kids through, pretty much by force, as if it's some law of nature that kids must endure a coercive system by the time they're 6, and give the best hours of the day to that system until they're dead, in order to facilitate their development of wisdom and utility to other people (as opposed to stress, bullying, and hurting other people through more such endless cycles of coercive systemic brainwashings and zombie-ism).

Those environments are where we learn that some people are inferior to others, namely, students, to teachers and adults, with potentially permanent life-threatening consequences. And those structures disseminate to the relationships between kids. 

#### Hair regrowth

> This chapter would need editing

I was on a mostly-steak-only diet since at least April, 2020 (with wild caught salmon as well). That regrowth started during Tayler, and before the Bar Mitzvah hospitalization. In the Bar Mitzvah hospitalization, it was already regrown in parts and regrowing in others. When my self consciousness returned and I started periodically wearing a hat, the older Sarah woman copied the look and started also wearing a hat when I did. Mobi remarked on my hair  when we saw a Duplumab commercial and I mentioned that the drug made me lose my hair ("oh that’s why"). And I was walking around bravely sometimes, past all the nurses and patients, from my room to the phone without hat. But the point is, my hair was already growing back, and was already in patches everywhere (on my head), when I was on the steak/salmon-only diet and before the Bar Mitzvah hospitalization. Specifically, at that time (before the Bar Mitzvah hospitalization), I was eating one wild caught salmon every morning and about 5 organic, grassfed, grass-finished steaks per day, and water. In other words, most of my income was going towards recovering from the benzo brain damage, and — while it was working for mood and energy and cognition — I had no idea it would help with hair regrowth.

And, by the way, that sudden hair regrowth was 2 years after the summer of the Dupilumab cessation that induced the alopecia universalis. Full head hair regrowth in alopecia universalis is nearly unprecedented. Actually, even more medically rare/unprecedented: full head hair regrowth in alopecia universalis with comorbid eczema.

In the next hospitalization, in the geriatric unit, there was another guy my age. I sat with him every day towards my last days there at the window. He and I talked. I described Tayler to him in vague terms. We were talking about deep things, really deep things. I told him about my self consciousness about my hair, since chunks of it were falling out again in that geriatric unit, and he said he couldn’t even tell anything was bald. I think he even had some balding that he showed me, and said that he loses hair all the time, that my hair looked good, and not to worry. In other words, my hair had fully grown back, enough to pass the eye test of a guy sitting right next to me.

But, in case the detail was missed ("since chunks of it were falling out again in that geriatric unit"), it was there that it turned out to be falling out again, and proceeded to partially for months after, to the point that now it looks worse than it would've had it never grown back, and I have to shave it to maintain the bald upper bound of my current mutilated appearance.

- I even fasted during Tayler, before the Bar Mitzvah hospitalization, before my hair grew back, so strict discipline wasn't what caused it to fall out in December. It was a prolonged fast, about 7 days. I did 3 prolonged fasts in my life. Only that one corresponded (later) with hair regrowth. During that period, before my hair regrowth and during Tayler and before the Bar Mitzvah hospitalization, I was only doing steak/salmon-only diet, strictly. That was the recurrence where my head fully grew back hair completely (TO DO: link to photo of me).
- The Bar Mitzvah hospitalization had given me a lot of junk food and I was eating lots of sweets after, as well, still on the dietary momentum from that hospitalization, even chocolate-chip cookies and cakes and things like that, somewhat addictively. But then I resumed strict discipline and a steak-primarily diet maybe a month or so after. I think steak/salmon-only. Amazingly, my eczema didn't return during the Bar Mitzvah hospitalization or after. Eczema was teh reason I couldn't visit Tayler, though I wnated to, but at that point Tayler was seeing other guys, not to mention still living, as I'd learned, with her ex-boyfriend, not the bald Jewish husband.
- Besides the geriatric unit hospitalization, the period of eating sweets starting from the Bar Mitzvah hospitalization might've caused the hair loss. Other than those two hospitalizations, the social pain of losing Tayler might've contributed as well. The other two times my hair would grow back happened during an isolated period and a more-social period, respectively, both when I was strictly doing steak/salmon-only diet with some Paleo leniency. The isolated period was also a work-intensive period, but there was less pressure on me at that time from Chenliang than during the December, 2020 when my hair started falling out, since in December, 2020 I was under strict deadlines and in a new group, whereas later I earned credibility in Chenliang's group and was more permitted to manage my own labor (more so anyway, and in addition to the Mechanical Engineering lab I was assigned to). However, the late-Summer, 2020 hair regrowth also happened while Chenliang was already my advisor. Those isolated-period hair regrowth and more-social period hair regrowith are discussed more below in [Future hair losses](#future-hair-losses).
- My hair was falling into my hands first in the geriatric unit in December, 2020.

#### Future hair losses

My pubic hair grew back in 2021 while doing a strict steak/salmon-only diet with some Paleo leniency — it was definitely still grown back while I was doing that diet in December, 2021 — and fell out gradually. 
- That hair grew back already in the period when Chenliang’s group was reasonably impressed with me (which never concluded, I don't think), though I was working too hard and exercising too many disciplines that alienated me from people socially. I imposed those disciplines on myself for multiple reasons, but mood, cognition, and willpower were the main benefits besides hair regrowth at that point, and I believed they were helping my social life, not hurting it, since that was my primary purpose for them, as I concurrently had to do an enormous amount of work for Chenliang, and two separate labs, and the hair growth from the previous time I did those diets was still pretty abundantly on my head, and looked good enough [as long as I wore hats](https://youtu.be/VKoSfmECpx0?si=iqPaLB1gmGQnd3xb). So the appreciation from his group (and him, actually), and the other group, probably is what helped that pubes regrowth (congrats), combined with the diet, but it’s not surprising that that hair gradually fell out, as almost all of my efforts were targeted towards connecting with people, socially, as, despite my serious efforts, through everything humanly possible that could've been advised or asked of me (everything, no matter what "more" or "less" idea popped into your head), I was becoming increasingly more alienated, connected to a yogic trance in nature at that point everyday that I didn't allow to get me hospitalized or disturb my work, and my isolation would remain to be the case until my best friend returned in 2023, who amazingly did not reject my insanity, whatsoever. Hence eyelashes.

My eyelashes started growing back for the first time in summer, 2023, when I'd started doing the steak/salmon-only diet again, and my best friend returned into my life, and fell out shortly after I was terminated, at which time I also had gone more lenient on my steak/salmon-only diet, due to the combination of more stress (from that termination) and lacking an income. Those three eyelashes that had grown back one by one gradually up to that point, that summer, starting that summer, grew back for the first time ever in the 5 full years since losing all of my hair. Then each fell out, but I attribute them to my best friend, who returned that summer, and probably also the correlating steak/salmon-only diet that I'd resumed before his return, earlier in 2023, after the weather had already gotten warm. Though, besides steak/salmon during that period when my eyelashes started to grow back for the first time, I allowed myself organic tea on that one, as well. Then, when I was terminated by this wonderful university of mine that had cost me my hair in the first place, my newly miracle'd eyelashes fell out suddenly.

However, adding this seems to undermine just how severe the injustice we're talking about is.

The bullies at the University of Rochester's hospital and research institutions don't understand that they botched every action they took in their judgements, treatments, policies, decision-making, and (as will be shown, though hopefully it's apparent already) rulings, and did everything humanly possible, sometimes by blunder rather than on purpose, to take away and waste my dignity, money, social life, physical body, and work.

#### Intimacy healing

Depression, anxiety, PTSD, and [touch starvation](https://youtu.be/4zJXr4jeP5w?si=bQCCeK4_Cxv1MbL1) might be treatable through intimacy.

I propose a new branch of medicine called intimacy healing, one with an ontology like as follows: communications as a subset of intimacy healing, intimacy healing as a subset of medicine, with overlaps but distinction from sex work. 

Independently, sex work should be legalized, regarded as a subset of fine art, formally and academically, but distinct from intimacy healing, and the branches of medicine and fine art can overlap.

Radical idea, but that's the direction. Humans need each other. Relationships are the most fundamental part of life, more of a basic necessity than food, water, shelter, or drugs.

Perhaps my alternative would've served better, and given her a spiritual, healthy way to resolve a human struggle that all of us share.

#### The artificial and synthetic

I'm all for [#SexycareForAll](#comedic-aside-sexier-moments-during-chenliang-tenure), but that's not quite what I have to say.
- And note, via humans.

The use of drugs, porn, movies, TV shows, and technologies shouldn't be judged or shamed. 

Many people are happy relying on those things, others appreciate the art.

Big pharma companies find value in their mass proliferation re: drugs.

And tech companies find value in their mass proliferation re: porn, fleshlights, dildos.

I'm anti-prohibition. My message is only this: the best experiences of a person's life shouldn't be synthetic. Those experiences should be brought into the real world, for people who want or need them, where the experiences people need and want are available foremost in the real world, via people, sincerely, intimately, and via touch, no matter one's "social class." [Imagine all the people, living life in peace.](https://youtu.be/YkgkThdzX-8?si=YNzRr6gnKtG4jywG)

And that must be understood as distinct from capitalistic drug-like fixes that people pay for.

Intimacy healing is a step towards that, starting with medical institutions.

#### AI
  
AI is a field with a lot of ethics questions, and the [militaristic](https://www.politico.eu/article/robots-coming-ukraine-testing-ground-ai-artificial-intelligence-powered-combat-war-russia/), [survelliance](https://bigdatachina.csis.org/the-ai-surveillance-symbiosis-in-china/#:~:text=With%20regard%20to%20China%2C%20it,data%20acquired%20through%20government%20contracts.) uses out there, in combination with this paper factory progress and pressure to turn out papers, is a boding sign that those questions are being answered extraordinarily incorrectly by the people giving the grades.

### Niaz Abdolrahim (okay, some more not-tragedy)

In my fourth year, I was assigned to also work in the Mechanical Engineering group that Niaz (who was a great PI) led. Then in my 6th year, it was still while working half-part there, with Niaz, Chenliang, and team, that Chenliang (who symbolically led the deep learning side of the work, with me leading the deep learning side of the work) called me into his office in the CS building where his lab meetings, including me (both my office and attendance to those meetings, as well), were held, towards which most of my 70-hour-per-week labor was going, to inform me that he didn't think I had enough papers (this was while he knew we were in the middle of a paper-review, a paper on which I had second-author, on which Chenliang, and according to Chenliang, Niaz, had previously offered me first-author — and I rejected — twice — out of fairness to the other PhD student — for a paper with highly positive reviews), and due to that low number of publications, he would be deserting.

The paper got accepted, after my termination notice and on the day before my last day as an employed student, in fact, synchronistically, a minute after I referenced it in the email I sent shown in the next ["Disproof" chapter](3-Disproof.md#email-10302023).

Chenliang put me on the Mechanical Engineering lab as the source of my funding, on a project which I led, which was funded by two pretty-major grants that I helped write, which included my ideas, which somehow, by Chenliang's and very-much-not-Niaz's decision, wouldn't fund me any longer.

Niaz, not an "opposing view," and someone I really like, was my other Principle Investigator next to Chenliang. Oh but to be clear, I was still in Chenliang's lab and reporting to that lab as well every week. I was doing extreme amounts of work for both, the latter of which I haven't really started describing yet. 

For Niaz's group, I did a lot of programming, data generation and pipeline-optimizing; much of the systems; idea invention and schematic designing; grant-idea-providing-and-writing-and-diagram-designing; and all of the model building and experiment running and plotting.

In Chenliang's group, I was still trying to do my own research, which was pretty heavily bottlenecked. That's part of why I was practicing every discipline imaginable — from Wim Hof method freezing cold baths to Transcendental Meditation to yoga to strict steak/salmon-only diet to every ascetecism I could not-hope for — to achieve the [full scope](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML-legacy) of what I wanted to do for [both](https://github.com/AGI-init/XRDs).

When Chenliang told me he couldn't be my advisor, I asked Niaz if she could be. She said the process of transferring to the mechanical engineering department formally wasn't that simple, that maybe she could contact the Dean, and that she sympathized sincerely. She also advised that I reach out to the CARE Network, something I at first took some mild offense to, because I messaged her on Slack about the key specifics of the medical institution hair and benzo trauma, and she clarified, no, she meant reaching out to them for a lawyer. I appreciated that. I'm grateful Chenliang forced me on that work because of Niaz. But I did a lot for them in the Mechanical Engineering department, concurrent with my studies in AI separately in his lab, and I had no choice because that project's grants, were funding me, and I helped write two of their big ones (endowing the pretty-small group with upwards of a million dollars), with their names as authors and me uncredited. I did a lot of engineering and data work for them that was independent to my research, that ordinarily would get paid a 6-figure salary for, while I have never been paid more than $15/hr in my life, and the termination left me with tons of student debt.

So you see, because my family was poor, my student debt (for the University of Rochester) was subsidized for as long as I was a student. So when I was terminated, that interest started accumulating, and I had/have to pay them/the lenders the large sum of money (in the above-the-Biden-loan-cancellation ranges, even the Pell grant one I would've gotten). So literally speaking, financially, I was "indebted for their services" for terminating me, which I had to swallow. This is the same University of Rochester I've been describing for multiple chapters now.

Makes me want to go #NotEnoughPapers, for the many thousands of dollars reverse-severance they gave me as gratitude.

However, that lab is the least of the work I did ([here](5-Early-work-in-program.md)/[here](6-Indebted.md)/[here](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML-legacy)/[here](https://github.com/AGI-init/XRDs)/[here](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder)/[here](https://github.com/AGI-init/Tributaries)/[here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZQFeiOKSU2teVGg5EHlgREAi8pJY_Mr1CJ3H2pfFBfI/edit?usp=sharing)), at sometimes slave wage by force, with PhD requirements that were usually uniquely put on me, from the same institution that mutilated the hair and youth from my body and face, and neurochemically gassed my brain, then terminated me and scapegoated me for their 6 years of atrocities, negligences, and greed.

They Holocausted me.

They Holocausted me. By whatever legal definition exists, they Holocausted me. Every lawyer agrees, that by whatever legal definition exists, they Holocausted me.

Now rewind in time a bit. Not to the days of the Canaanites, but to the days before Chris Kanan.

Two of my advisors and two of my committee members deserted, for funsies, e.g. sabbaticals (I barely had time for Sabbath), promotions, retirement, funding reallocation, etc., and I was left with a brand new interim committee, consisting of Chenliang Xu, who had just announced his desertion, Charles Venuto, who worked in the Med Center and had no expertise in AI, Chris Kanan, last-minute added interim committee member, and Tom Howard, last-minute added interim committee member.

I never effectively met half of my committee, we had one 20-minute Zoom call in which I presented, and then an after-room discussion.

In defense of the committee members who agreed on the decision, most of them didn't know me and hadn't met each other or me previously, and one of them, Chris Kanan, in a kind of *deus ex machina* (or so I thought, since that should have conclusively settled it), [mis-remembered](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Deus-Ex-Memory.md) the short Zoom meeting that the four of us had (I highly recommend clicking on that link), on which these decisions from their end were based, as being 1.5 hours and twice. That is quite a lapse in memory (and Chris Kanan is the youngest). The meeting was 30 minutes, and once, as the other committee members may recall and confirm. The calendar invitation that that committee member, Chris Kanan, accepted, wrote: "Friday May 5, 2023 ⋅ 1pm – 1:45pm (Eastern Time - New York)" (extra lag time added). I have on email to one committee member Tom Howard that we planned half an hour: "Would you be available any of the following dates for a half-hour remote 6-month review?" It can be confirmed that it was 30 minutes in which I had to summarize 6 years of work over Zoom: 20ish minutes spent on my presentation, then 5ish minutes for their independent-room discussion and 5 minutes for their concluding remarks. 

I should add details about the work that Chris Kanan asked me to do, or suggested rather, that I followed through on. Maybe in this [chapter](3-Disproof.md) and [this one](6-Indebted.md), but see terminator-bubble-diagram immediately above and I'll summarize below.

Long-term memory is what I was working on longest. From the Spring semester of my Freshman year, 
- when I built a long-term episodic memory reinforcement learning controller on top of image features from Felzenshwalb segmentation in Chenliang Xu's machine vision class,
- to that semester where I actually did meet Tom Howard for 5 minutes and told him about using the idea for robotics when we went to his robotics lab because he took an interest (and that short exchange is the only time I talked to him prior to this),
- to when I impressed a researcher at DeepMind at NeurIPS (then called "NIPS") 2018 about MHDPA — taht I was using for a related concept, [as seen in my area exam slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LK0urIs8yu_e7HyZ-VQoDJUiGpPeTPEUgfhjK5Kw_7w/edit?usp=sharing) — in Montreal (and still have the different conversation with Jürgen Schmidhuber that I got to have at that conference evidenced in our email record, whose hand I'm glad I got to shake at the end of his presentation), and by the way I remember coding my MHDPA paper in that stay's hotel,
- to plenty of email-record (e.g. with Prof. Len Schubert),
- as well as my area exam,
- as well as my thesis proposal,
- as well as what I was doing at the Med Center that Charles Venuto has email record and memory of,
- up to even this meeting with the new committee, where I showed [all of what I had done on that (lifelong, adaptive, rewritable, growing, accelerated Replay Memory for use in RL or supervised learning or generative modeling) and more](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZQFeiOKSU2teVGg5EHlgREAi8pJY_Mr1CJ3H2pfFBfI/edit?usp=sharing).

Coincidentally, they all had evidence that this is something I was trying to do through my full PhD, and *for some reason* — I'll let you guess why — maybe didn't get to. Everybody wanted me to pursue their different independent area research. Except Chris Kanan. Who suggested, wisely, after that 20-minute Zoom meeting, by email one month after I delivered a big new research proposal as they insanely requested, that I develop a brand new reinforcement learning systems algorithm for my giant built-from-scratch deep learning library/framework [UnifiedML](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder), and I did within two months ([here is one of the commits](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/commit/e8b896c75bdeb388995af912a25108dfa16a92f9) when I finished implementing [it, sampling without replacement within a priority, accelerated, parallelized, hard-disk-memory-mappable Replay Memory using truly-shared RAM memory, dynamically growable and rewritable and unified with supervised and generative modeling](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML/blob/ef14f7ff14b0b494d14bc8ee4bfe8925ad2a1fb3/ML/World/Replay.py#L566-L607), innovating on the state of the art reinforcement learning algorithm/system DrQV2, which very much does not do the vast majority of those things), the day before the meeting with Chenliang, when I told him about my algorithm/system in [my UnifiedML framework](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZQFeiOKSU2teVGg5EHlgREAi8pJY_Mr1CJ3H2pfFBfI/edit?usp=sharing) — and it actually is brilliant — and he liked it dismissively, then proceeded to tell me he couldn't be my advisor because I didn't have enough papers. It was a good meeting, but he didn't know what he was doing.

It is the first rewritable DataLoader that serves as a Replay for supervised, generative, and reinforcement learning as well as the novel algorithm for sampling without replacement, something that is standardly done in the former two but had never been done for priority experience replays in the latter, especially not in combination with lifelong storage capacity via [dynamic device allocation](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/blob/64c92d7bf5c09642e161548c36625739884b01f7/UnifiedML/src/ML/World/Memory.py#L103-L107), [hard disk memory mapping](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/blob/64c92d7bf5c09642e161548c36625739884b01f7/UnifiedML/src/ML/World/Memory.py#L524-L543), and [truly-shared in-RAM adaptive memory](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/blob/64c92d7bf5c09642e161548c36625739884b01f7/UnifiedML/src/ML/World/Memory.py#L59-L150), in other words though extremely reductive: an accelerated parallelized DataLoader whose contents can be changed by the agent, and which include generalized sampling methods even when the dataset size is growing such as in a priority experience replay for DataLoader, and all of this added with a truly state of the art reinforcement learning algorithm/system DrQV2 as well as others with support for continuous and discrete domains, online or offline learning, and on-policy or off-policy, all of which — yes, all of which — I generalized into a unified API and framework to fully support supervised, generative, and reinforcement learning, the most general DataLoader/Experience Replay/Memory ever built, capable also of storing and updating parameters, not just data, meaning all of this with support for deep neural Memory, not just dataset-centric. Nothing like it exists — I’m afraid PyTorch or somebody will try to copy it upon reading this. The value of it was so immense and this brand new interim committee — all except Chris Kanan — had not the faintest scent of that — well, that's not true, Chenliang thought I could start a business and just cared about papers, but note, I needed his GPUs to finish. By the way, pretty much fully implemented, [and elegantly so](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/blob/main/UnifiedML/src/ML/World/Memory.py) (but with no GPUs to finalize the small amount of work left on the library/framework as a whole, nor funding or undestroyed-human-spirit left to write the immense amount of documentation still needed, and personally, I think this book takes priority, not to mention, I've released all the code open-source under the MIT license, so traditional funding routes aren't an option anyway, plus I have other interconnected plans for my research, if given the reigns/money-rains to make it happen). Since I started building it for my PhD (from about 2021, in Chenliang's lab, onwards), some similar works have come out, like PyTorch’s entire reinforcement learning library, but none compare (the system was being built within a GATO/JEPA-type framework before either of those were published/announced). And has an [interface that plug-and-play substitutes the normal PyTorch DataLoader](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/blob/main/UnifiedML/src/ML/World/Replay.py). It’s also accelerated and faster in every substantive way for supervised, too, at least Pytorch's default DataLoader, but possibly the more intricate accelerators, and was the first infrastructure in Chenliang Xu’s Computer Vision lab [capable of training ImageNet efficiently from scratch](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/blob/main/tributaries-ml/src/tributaries/Examples/Sweeps/ImageNet.py), something not one other student in his Computer Vision lab — even with the most published papers — had (and probably "has" as of time of writing) ever done. To be clear, I was the first student in his PhD lab’s history — officially ranked one of the [top in the world in Computer Vision](https://csrankings.org/#/fromyear/2020/toyear/2024/index?vision&us) — to use any infrastructure (his or otherwise) for training ImageNet from scratch (meaning, not via fine-tuning an ImageNet-pre-trained model, nor just using a subset of the ImageNet dataset), the gold standard of his field, all within a GATO/JEPA type generalized (and more general than either of them) framework (whose construction also preceded both of those, by the way). That being said, his students, perhaps more so than Chenliang, appreciated what I was doing, though Chenliang knew it could've been valuable, and was good enough for a PhD. Both him and Niaz said I was ready to defend. Chenliag wanted me to write my thesis before he cut his funding, yet again on an impossible deadline. But a thesis is more important than a conference paper, and I couldn't have.

### Tom Howard

</p>

The independent-room discussion reasonably marked the end of my portion of the meeting, or so I thought. However, after the independent-room discussion, we kept talking, I left, and Chenliang later told me that the committee members thought I dropped the line early. That was a misunderstanding. I really thought the meeting was over since they conveyed everything I had to do next, or at least that they were going to in that discussion. At the very, very end of the discussion, one of the committee members, Tom Howard, said, "I just want to add, I think it’s important." I actually in my sleep deprivation thought he meant my work (I suspect he probably meant the chapter-list), so I did a sincere and prolonged "bless you" sign with my hands in the silence and left. I know that this is the least believable part. Chenliang knew via Slack I hadn’t slept that whole night, due to insomnia and maybe-nervousness, and I mentioned that "I didn't sleep all night" during the meeting to which I think Tom Howard off-handedly, maybe-non-noticedly said "I know," before resuming his point. 

Chenliang had to take his dog to the vet, for that matter. Either his wife did or him, but the meeting had to be no more than half an hour by what he told me. How we scheduled, over Slack. 
- If I left early, it’s further justified by what Chenliang wrote to me on Slack, about needing to take his dog to the vet immediately after the meeting, assumed 30 minutes, his wife possibly being able to do it, or otherwise having to reschedule the vet to later in the day, all of which probably can be verified with either his vet or his wife or just his calender.

He (Tom Howard) concluded the meeting saying "I just want to add, I think it’s important" in reference to the chapter-list, and I did a "bless you" sign with my hands, as I'd on previous occasion felt the need to do after a robotics-related pitch to Chenliang's group coincidentally, in-person in Chenliang's lab, and robotics is Tom Howard's field. That was a coincidence though. It was just a vivid moment in Chenliang's lab, with all of his students there as witness, when he agreed to buy me one of the $300 Bittle robots that I could use with the robotics software that I [built](https://github.com/AGI-init/tributaries/blob/main/Examples/Sweeps/Bittle.py), that I did a "bless you" sign for in gratitude. I meant it in a similar way to Tom Howard, but I interpreted "I just want to add, I think it’s important" as being in reference to my research, not the chapter-list.

The chapter-list was the only requirement they wanted to make in that meeting. We had the entire after-independent-room discussion and they didn't specify anything other than the chapter-list. I'm sure they weren't going to. Perhaps one of them can even confirm that nothing more than the chapter-list was discussed as extra requirement in their independent-room meeting. That was clear from context.

But afterwards, I got an email — I think from Chenliang and perhaps from the graduate coordinator — specifying two altogether different requirements, with only an auxiliary mention of the chapter-list. Here they were, as apparently decided by the committee (post-hoc) after their chapter-list decision in the actual six-month review:

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> As remediation, the committee asks the student to
>
> 1.   before June 5, 2023, provide a 1-page write up that addresses the problem statement, hypothesis, and approaches of the thesis and give an outline of thesis chapters,
> 2.    before August 30, 2023, re-do and pass a six-month review.
> ### $\Huge &#8221;$

It's ironic that I'm being asked for remediation.

I don't know who decided these extra requirements, if it was the CS chair Michael Scott, or Tom Howard, or Chris Kanan, or even Chenliang.

I delivered a 6-page write up, as well as a chapter-list, as well as a 1-page write up summary in the 6-page write up, meeting all of the requirements of (1) for this brand new interim committee that effectively never met me. 

Subsequently, Chris Kanan suggested that I innovate a new reinforcement learning systems-based algorithm (also suggesting it post-hoc), which I did, as I described [above](#chris-kanan).

These are enormous requirements that I met on their behalf.

Tom Howard didn't make any tangible, explicit, or otherwise suggestions, nor did my advisor or Charles. (The committee consisted of 4 people, my advisor Chenliang, Chris Kanan, Tom Howard, and Charles).

The actual six-month review was **May 5th, 2023**. Then Chenliang notified me of his desertion on **July 24th, 2023**, a day after I finished implementing the [novel reinforcement learning systems-based algorithm](https://github.com/AGI-init/UnifiedML/blob/ef14f7ff14b0b494d14bc8ee4bfe8925ad2a1fb3/ML/World/Replay.py#L566-L607) (and [here](https://github.com/slerman12/Builder/commit/e8b896c75bdeb388995af912a25108dfa16a92f9) is the specific commit), and Chenliang confirmed by email the desertion for the rest of the committee and Michael Scott on **August 10th, 2024**, the same day as my [early in-advance-of notice](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Not-Enough-Carbs.md) to the committee and Michael Scott that I wouldn't attend the requirement (2), prior to the **August 30, 2023** date of requirement (2).

</p>

I have to elaborate more on Charles since he was on my six-month review committee.

Charles was still on my committee from the Med Center years, but was about to be replaced after this latest six-month review by my PI of the last several years [Niaz](#niaz-abdolrahim) (the work for whom was funding me), as she agreed.

Charles was my Med Center advisor. Charles and Henry both oversaw me in those first 3 years, before Henry's promotion meant I had to switch into Chenliang's lab and start an altogether new Computer Vision-branch focus of research, with an ultimatum to submit a top-venue paper that summer *in* Computer Vision, literally a brand new field to me. And I did. Amazingly. Though that seems to be unappreciated (the benchmarks and conventions for actual acceptance, though not necessarily principle of concept, are more elaborate than just plopping MHDPA on top of a CNN, had I done that). However, the [explainability-centric paper that I came up with, derived, wrote, and programmed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08601) would not have been my preferred research area, since I was working on MHDPA and long-term episodic memory methods for Charles in the Med Center (and Henry) prior to that, and wrote [my novel MHDPA method paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgmmzgsrctmg#6cd1b9) before MHDPA had any popularity or reknown outside of small groups at DeepMind. MHDPA, for the uninitiated, became the backbone, 5 years later, of foundation models like ChatGPT. Henry doubted my obsession with the method back in 2018. No one at the university heard of it. And when switching to Chenliang's lab, he wasn't too thrilled with the idea of applying it to Semantic Image Segmentation, in what would've been perhaps (with some rarely-credited DeepMind experiments at the time having already done it on CNNs as the exception) the first Vision Transformer (since it would've had to convincingly beat baseline scores on Computer Vision benchmarks, which those DeepMind experiments hadn't applied the method on, and rarely are given the credit, despite unified principle of concept). So instead, under an employment-contingent ultimatum, I co-wrote my ICCV [Taylor-CAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08601) paper under Chenliang with Henry and Charles. Charles and I managed to sneak biomedical modeling into the appendix (see Appendix J, rather invisible).

I credited Charles as co-author on that paper, however they at the Med Center did not credit me for the prototype of the disease prognostication [model]((https://github.com/slerman12/DiseaseModeling)) (since developed since that original version that won in the PPMI contest, mentioned early [above](#charles-venuto)) and [website]((https://github.com/slerman12/DiseaseModelingWebApp)) I came up with, had to argue for, built, and presented in DC in front of reknowned Parkinson's disease researchers, a poster and live demo presentation that also wasn't credited (and not to mention was still amid the very peak of my benzo withdrawal, that I had to take a benzo for to present).

I haven't spoken to Charles since we added that biomedical component to my [Taylor-CAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08601) paper and he didn't say a word during the six-month review. I mean not a word, except — maybe — hi, and his video was off. That's 1/4 of the deciding committee, whose decision hinged on that meeting (on whose decision around that meeting determined my termination), who didn't have his video on or say a word during the deciding meeting. The other two were brand new interim replacements for other committee members who were absent. So that just leaves my advisor Chenliang, who didn't want to terminate me, who just wanted to reallocate my funding from the Mechanical Engineering group due to not enough papers in his Computer Vision group, and who believed my research was satisfactory enough to defend that month (of my termination), if I just "followed [his] formatting instructions" for the thesis that I hadn't started writing, that he thought I could write quickly.

So in other words: Chris Kanan (who [didn't remember the meeting](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Deus-Ex-Memory.md)) and Tom Howard fully determined my termination, besides Michael L. Scott.

> The [eczema this is presently giving me](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Eczema.md) as I type is severe. My arms are scathing red. I'm itchy and can't sleep, rolling around under my blankets in a burning panic, nails grinding to skin on arms, trying to shed the stress from this inflicted evil of judgement. The reader's possible mixed perceptions in my head, all the ways this could be re-done to be made more convincing and believed haunting the scorching thought rivers. Like ants on my arms literally, burning rivers as blood, my arteries need to be dug of their hidden psychological poison, my brain says; my brain pierces and threatens as it sends those coursing swarms stingingly down the lengths of my typing limbs, even now, as I try to put that burning disturbing pleasure and agony into words, if not the claws of my nails where skin residue bulks and swells. Please reader in the hidden ether, stop doing this to me. Send love, not this terror of threat and divided consciousness that broils as war between my body and the depths of my mind and senses.

> The torment doesn't stop until I finish this. I'm slave driven by my skin, as I was by my advisors, committees, and professors. I fear that you are all so stupid, that none of you will see the truth of this, that you will act as allies to the contagion that plagues my stress rather than as people who know the heart no matter the veil or law of land or powers that be.

Maybe one of the strongest Opposing Views, which the remainder of this book will be devoted to obliterating is the CS department Chair who comes in at this point for the first time in my PhD, Michael L. Scott (The Messenger as he'd might've called himself), or: The Judge.

His Opposing View is only strong because of its window of context. Unlike Chenliang and Charles, he didn’t know me. Unlike Chris Kanan, he wasn’t in my field. And unlike Tom Howard, he didn’t and couldn’t have even been relevant to a six-month review, since he had no background or expertise whatsoever in anything relevant to the future of his field (to be fair) or mine. The future of his field is my field, for that matter.

That makes him an extremely strong Opposing View.

Michael made a lot of false allegations prior to and after terminating me, in fact almost entirely false allegations, entirely false or hypocritical allegations. For most of the time, his belief was that he was terminating me for more serious reasons than the six-month review make-up. He believed my research was inadequate, "unviable," and that I had to propose a new research "plan." "Plan" — in one’s 6th year when advisor and PI already believed I could defend on the work that I had that month.

My advisor and PI weren’t right, because I needed peace to write my thesis. That’s where Michael’s exercise in unearned ruling authority (over me anyway) was the most extreme.

And suspicious.

I call this the Termination Slam.

His previous email read:

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> If I do not hear from you by 6 Oct., with a plan for successful completion, the department will terminate your stipend and discontinue your enrollment as of 31 Oct. 2023.
> ### $\Huge &#8221;$
> &ensp;&ensp;- **09/25/2023**

In other words, 'Send the department my "new research plan" (despite the advisor and PI believing I was ready to defend) by **10/06/2023**, now an added independent requirement to the previously delivered materials to the independent six-month review committee.'

Then I delivered another research plan, with precision and accuracy, by the specified date **10/06/2023**. 

This was the only reply I got, of **10/12/2023**:

> ### $\Huge &#8220;$
> Dear Sam:

> Thank you for your note of 6 Oct.  I have conferred with members of your committee.  They confirm that the plan you outline is neither consistent with what you originally proposed for the PhD nor a viable path to completion of the degree.

I delivered what was requested and he put his boot down on my sincerity and effort. That boot despite what was threatened and said is why it was a Termination Slam, not just a termination. On personal and highly elaborate work that was sent to him (and CC'd Chenliang) about all of my research, and the plan to defend after I write my thesis.

Later, he specified the detail he didn’t like. No no, it wasn’t the research-related material, as he later self-contradicted, it was my request for "peace" towards the end.

However, this alone does not damn Michael. He was CC’d on or I sent him, *all* of the context. At first, he got the [medical context]() and only the research "context" from the brand new interim committee, later the research context, and gradually he realized that his only justification for the termination — despite what he previously specified — was a measly six-month review make-up, the one that was post-hoc both with respect to advisor desertion and requirement (which I warned [on **08/10/2023**](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Not-Enough-Carbs.md) I wasn't going to attend, that Michael was CC'd for), and which is a formalism that isn’t under any ordinary PhD circumstance considered that important.

But at that point he stayed doubled down.

The boss battle was over, and I lost.

To be clear, what I mean is I disproved the whole constitution that they drew the make-up review requirement from, in math, and showed that they were violating their policy. That they are violating their policy. And that mathematically derived disproof [will appear in the Epilogue of the part titled "Ongoing"](7-Ongoing.md), not in the part titled "Disproof" ([coming up next](3-Disproof.md)).</sub>

#

Michael doesn’t know this, but in the systems class I took with him in undergrad, he gave me the lowest grade I’ve ever gotten in any class, ever, kindergarten through PhD, in a systems class, and I do not like systems (not the coercive kind anyway). He even bumped it up a very-very little. Now Michael ultimately relayed the ruling to terminate, on the "basis" of the committee, and not one, but, as he claimed, [two](7-Ongoing.md) six-month reviews ([and this make-up!](7-Ongoing.md)). Michael mentioned the possibility of applying for reinstatement, though what that means is unclear, especially as: Did he mean I needed to find yet another advisor, new source of funding, re-take a six-month review, do my thesis, and do all of this still recovering from traumas in my 6th year, for less than New York State's legal living wage, or no pay, within the next one to few months? 

See "Slavery or impossible" [here](3-Disproof.md) (in the next chapters) for elaboration on what was demanded on me *together with* the six-month review make-up.

For all of the aforementioned reasons, and final, I was terminated without degree. 6 years of the hardest work the university has ever seen thrown away and spit on, with no accountability, from the same single monopoly and institution that induced multiple medical malpractices on me, mutilated me into looking like Gollum literally, and put me through a literal physiological coerced burning hellfire for more than a year that can't be described. Meanwhile, those years in the program involved two advisors leaving due to no fault of my own, having to work in the Medical Center and Mechanical Engineering department for funding, and a quarter to a half a year as I worked for Chenliang for free.

These are just words. He didn't acknowledge anything I said, separately or together. He occasionally wrote that he disagreed with the characterization, and made no argument as to why.

### Summary of why interim

The committee that terminated me was a brand new *interim* committee, for just one meeting, for which they post-hoc wanted a make-up before the next one that they wouldn’t even attend. 

Since I had to switch advisors, and my PI Niaz agreed to be on my defense committee instead of Charles (by my advisor’s suggestion just prior to the six-month review), and another committee member was returning, and assuming my old advisor would still remain on the committee, that means the entire brand new committee (3/4 members) — including all of the ones who made the termination decision and ruled that I needed a new research "plan" in my 6th year — were leaving. After that one 30-minute video call, they assumed all governing power over my studies, labor, and employment, simply because other faculty members left without warning (abandoned/deserted their "posts") last-minute. More egregiously, in case that doesn’t stress it, 2/4 of them (3/5 if you count Michael) aren’t in my field and have no background or expertise in my field. The only 1/4 who did, next to my advisor, was Chris Kanan, the one who provided the [Deus Ex Memory](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/Ancillary/Deus-Ex-Memory.md) in which he forgot the meeting, and on whose behalf I invented a new RL systems algorithm in less than 2 months during this 3 month period. 

That’s the whole story, and where in there is even the slightest administrative sense or rational mandate to make life-altering decisions?
